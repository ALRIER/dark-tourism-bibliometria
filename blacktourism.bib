abstract={On May 12 in2008, the big earthquake in western of Sichuan had been torn the earth and had grounded each complete happy family, then henceforth the disaster area people have laid down the sadness in heart which forever is unable to dissipate. Two years later, we entered the dark earth, seeing the great miracle of Communist Party of China led "three year reconstruction duty, two years basically complete ", where Five-Starred Red Flag flutters with the wind.Under extremely painful memory's we gradually expose the smiling face, where new cities village are standing in the green hill and blue water.And a big Eastern Dragon prepares to soar, which has been complied with the archaism "all things ready, only owes the east wind".This stretch of world have a heavy replacement face after two years, as a youth of China who never step into the land, I am very complex, which seems to be the countless words, actually compared to the palatial mountain, rapids of Minjiang River and retrieval the vitality in the face of the people.With the feeling, I wrote this article.From an economic perspective, the article examines the thought of wings before takeoff, and perhaps little correlation with the field trip, but I could not suppress this confusion which is only a brief analysis in order to have some reference for the really taking off and sustainable development of the economy. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Tourism plays an increasingly important role in the South African economy. Steady, gradual improvement in the socioeconomic position of the Black population has led to an increase in holiday activity and this sector of society is expected to account for the majority (55.3%) of the domestic tourism market by the turn of the century. Poor perception by the White population of the widening leisure interests of the Black sector means that the tourist industry is making insufficient planning provision for the forthcoming rapid expansion of this market area and the Black population is still faced with limited recreational choice. © 1988.},
