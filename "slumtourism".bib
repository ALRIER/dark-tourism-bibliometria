abstract={This article explores how so-called “slum” tourism commodifies poverty and violence, transforming urban deprivation into a tourism product. In particular, we pay ethnographic attention to the role of brokers who mediate encounters between residents and tourists. The article explores how brokers—tour guides, art curators and civil society organizations—work to mediate power structures and enact a specific representational-performative politics. In so doing, brokers play a key role in aestheticizing and performing poverty and violence and converting disadvantaged spaces into a tourist product. We argue that brokers are vital to the reproduction of existing inequalities and to the formation of new social relationships and subjectivities. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Urban transformations help shape new opportunities and create/re-create awareness in everyday living environments. It is not transformation in the infrastructural sense, but transformation in the form of a service industry producing socio-economic change that can result in inclusion and exclusion of people in the community, thus affecting the everyday living environment. Within this, we need to consider the tourist gaze and how users who visit/tour vulnerable living environments report perceptions of their experiences on forums such as TripAdvisor, which helps researchers frame understandings of commodification, opportunities/awareness and even authenticity (each addressed in this paper). This paper evaluates TripAdvisor posts of ‘Rio’s Rocinha Favela Tour’. In many respects, the notion of commodification, and even authenticity, runs through each theme, but the analysis and data posted to TripAdvisor challenges us to consider how a favela becomes a consumer product or a tourist attraction. The Rocinha Favela tour is widely publicised to prospective visitors as a chance to experience a living and working favela, the focus of the first theme presented in this paper. Given Rocinha has become a popular attraction in Rio, this leads to the second theme: opportunity or awareness. Opportunities do exist for people in the community to get involved in tourism, and turning the favela into a product helps shape and maintain awareness. The third theme builds on and relates to the previous two, but focuses more on the semblances of authenticity that emerges. To link the points highlighted in this paper, a discussion of soft power concerns relationships bonded through economic and cultural influence. Because favelas have become distinct attractions, it is cultural appeal and a different (residential) side of the city that persuades travellers to visit. Online and social media platforms for more than a decade now have played an important role today in projecting images and promoting authentic experiences based on user-perceptions, and this paper looks at how the users communicate their experiences. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Purpose: This purpose of this paper is to explore creative forms of tourism in South African townships. The developmental potential of slum tourism is contested. One challenge is to reconfigure extant forms of slum tourism into more sustainable alternatives that emphasise combatting poverty through generating economic opportunities and upgrading slum spaces. It is argued that creative tourism has a vital potential role in reshaping slum tourism in a responsible manner. Design/methodology/approach: This exploratory investigation identifies emerging examples of creative forms of tourism in two case study townships: Soweto in Johannesburg and Langa in Cape Town. Current examples and potential for future development are interrogated, and areas for further research are outlined. Findings: Emerging examples of creative tourism in townships with an emphasis on creative participatory experiences, creative spaces and creative cultural events are identified. It is suggested that creative tourism offerings based on cultural resources are under-developed, and potential exists for innovating and expanding creative tourism offerings in townships as a response to latent international and domestic visitor demands. Social implications: Creative township tourism provides a number of avenues for catalysing economic opportunities; ensuring that locals benefit directly, upgrading physical township spaces and offering alternatives to voyeuristic forms of slum tourism by enhancing the authenticity of visitor experiences. Originality/value: A new perspective on slum tourism is offered. Creative slum tourism has not been interrogated in the existing slum tourism and creative tourism literatures. This paper calls for more comprehensive empirical investigation on creative forms of tourism in townships and also in slums. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The development of poverty-stricken areas presents a critical challenge to achieving social sustainability. The emergence of pro-poor tourism provides a promising option for poverty alleviation and is attracting increasing attention. Previous studies have attempted to explore the effectiveness and patterns of pro-poor tourism. Currently, a quantitative and systematic review of pro-poor tourism (PPT) research seems to be missing. Thus, a scientometric approach is employed to build a knowledge map, with the aim of using bibliometric data to provide an objective and holistic perspective on PPT. Through the co-occurrence, cluster, and co-citation analyses of 164 related papers published from 2002 to 2018, six major themes (i.e., development, tourism management, sustainable tourism, protected areas, poverty, and slum tourism) are selected to showcase the current status of PPT research. Through the lens of a capabilities-based resource perspective, a three-dimensional PPT framework (including focus, emphasis, and motivation) is developed to structure future research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Slum tourism is a growing phenomenon in several cities in the global South. The objective in this conceptual paper is to analyse the development and critical challenges around slum tourism in the urban global South and to argue a case for 're-creating' slum tourism by building upon the potential for creative tourism. The focus is upon the 'townships' of South Africa. It is argued that South Africa provides an instructive case study in the international phenomenon of slum tourism and of its potential to be reimagined and developed in a responsible manner, including through an important role for creative tourism. Recommendations are offered for a research agenda on creative slum tourism. © 2019 Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Slum tourism as a topic of investigation has seen significant growth since the beginning of this decade with increasing theoretical and empirical depth. With this growth, some inconsistencies in conceptual framing and use of terminology have emerged. The purpose of this paper is to argue for township tourism in Soweto to be regarded as a form of heritage tourism rather than slum tourism—a notion which has entered the township tourism literature in recent years. This argument is presented through two sections of analysis and debate, using Vilakazi precinct in Soweto as a case study. Firstly, the paper analyses the emergence of township tourism as an academic focus in the literature and how it came to be classified as slum tourism, considering definitional conundrums. Various South African authors emphasise the struggle heritage character of township tourism. Secondly, the historical development of townships and tourism in these areas are interrogated. The empirical data offer the perspectives on tourism in their area from: (a) residents living in and around Vilakazi Street; and (b) tourists visiting the Vilakazi precinct. The analysis reveals that neither residents nor visitors consider the Vilakazi precinct or the larger area of Orlando West as a slum; rather they perceive tourism is the area to be connected to its struggle heritage. We accordingly stress that the term ‘slum tourism’ to describe township tourism in Soweto is inaccurate and is inconsistent with the views not only of residents and visitors, but also South African authors. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={In Delhi, former street children guide tourists around the streets they once inhabited and show how the NGOs they live with try to resocialize current street children. The “personal stories” they perform implicitly advocate simple solutions that conveniently fit the limited engagement of the tourists, whose ethical position is thereby validated in relation to the NGO. But this uncomplicated exchange of guides’ emotions for tourists’ capital is in the guides’ interest, because it allows them to set boundaries for the emotional labor of performing their past suffering. The guides are thus incentivized to work within a post-humanitarian logic, selling their stories as commodities, which then incentivize the tourists to act as consumers, who have little choice but to frame their declarations of solidarity with the children as acts of consumption. © Stichting Focaal and Berghahn Books.},

abstract={The townships of South Africa are peri-urban neighbourhoods defined by racial segregation, economic disparity, and geographic isolation. A product of the racist policies of apartheid, these spaces exist as exclusively black or ‘coloured’ neighbourhoods that present limited opportunities for mobility for residents. Since the end of apartheid, townships have increasingly come up under the tourists’ gaze as sites/sights of resistance, difference, and, urban adventure. While much of tourism scholarship on liminality to date has focused on tourism landscapes creating liminal opportunities for tourists, this paper details how tourism encounters may also become liminal opportunities for tourism hosts under certain conditions. While the tourism encounters take place in the familiar landscape that is home, they become liminal occasions in which to come face-to-face with the previously inaccessible Other and transform one’s relationship with them, with themselves, and with their home space. In conducting a critical discourse analysis with the texts of interviews with 16 township residents, a number of liminal moments were identified in participants’ descriptions of tourism encounters. Themes identified in this research include: (1) Pertaining to a change in social standing, economic state, relationships to/with the other; (2) Desire for engagement, transformation through encounter; (3) Transformation of one’s understanding of the physical landscape, and; (4) Transformation of one’s understanding of self. These themes are elucidated through the use of creative analytic practice (CAP) and demonstrate that while tourism encounters in the spaces of home do not involve a physical relocation, they can have a transformative effect in people for whom such encounters with the Other were previously forbidden. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This research is constructed based on the reality of slum tourism as a new phenomenon in the era of globalization. The locus is selected as it is related to Jakarta Hidden Tour case in Indonesia. The question posed is how to promote slum tourism in the Jakarta Hidden Tour to the international world and raison d'etre. To answer the problem formulation, the researcher uses eclectic analytical framework which are commodification theory by Karl Spracklen and destination marketing theory by Youcheng Wang and Abraham Pizam. By using qualitative method, departing from above-mentioned understanding, this paper claims that slum tourism in the case of Jakarta Hidden Tour as a form of valorization offered to the world. Whereby, the core argument is slum tourism phenomenon that arise in Indonesia is one of the dark side of Indonesia's economic development that generates inequality especially in big cities. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

abstract={Walking tours are common practice in urban tourism and are, historically, one of the earliest examples of urban tourism. Due to a rise in the demand for so-called “authentic” experiences in tourism in recent years, there has been a growth in different types of cultural walking tours, particularly in poor neighborhoods of major cities globally. The increase in these tours brings to light a number of questions concerning the ethics of taking people through poorer areas, where relatively vulnerable populations live and work. This paper highlights some of the potential ethical concerns around this type of tourism, while also mentioning the potential benefits. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Are Detroit ruin tours a form of morally permissible cultural tourism, or do these tours amount to a form of exploitation? To answer this question I compare Detroit ruin tours with ‘slum tours’ – guided tours of slums in the world’s major cities. I argue that exploitation of the sort we find in slum tourism also exists, to a lesser extent, in Detroit ruin tours. To show this I detail two different accounts of exploitation and argue that Ruth Sample’s account best captures what is most morally problematic with slum tours and ruin tours. I then identify the similarities and differences between slum tours and ruin tours, and provide suggestions for how ruin tours could be retooled to avoid some (but not all) of the worries of exploitation. Finally, I suggest that with the proper framing Detroiters could embrace photographic tours as a new form of cultural tourism. © Society for Applied Philosophy, 2016.},
references={(1953) Ruinlust, Taken from the German ‘ruinenlust’, , is a term first used in English (I believe) by Rose Macaulay in Pleasure of Ruins; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruins_photography, Ruin porn now has its own rather informative Wikipedia page; http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/30/detroit-ruins_n_4519731.html, To see Getty Images of Detroit ruin porn, please visit; The link between ruin appreciation and tourism is not accidental. The 18th century’s interest in ruins was triggered by the new practice of the ‘Grand Tour’. Those noblemen with enough money to tour Greece and Italy returned with stories of beautiful ruins; Binelli, M., How Detroit became the world capital of staring at abandoned old buildings (2012) New York Times Magazine, p. 9; Semuels, A., Detroits abandoned buildings draw tourists instead of developers’ (2013) LA Times, p. 25; Some think that one cannot be morally criticised for one’s attitude alone, only for expressing that attitude. On the other hand, Angela Smith persuasively argues in ‘Guilty Thoughts’ that one can be morally blameworthy for unexpressed attitudes or thoughts. While outside the scope of this article, I tend to agree with her assessment. Angela Smith, ‘Guilty thoughts’ (2011) Morality and the Emotions, pp. 235-256. , C. Bagnoli, (New York: Oxford University Press; Ruin appreciation is decidedly different than appreciation of photographs. In appreciating ruins, we are valuing the mark nature has on large-scale artefacts. As such, I see ruins as ‘hybrid’ objects: objects that are both artefactual and natural. As artefacts, we might appreciate them similarly to how we appreciate architecture. According to; Robinson, J., (2010) The Appreciation of Architecture Relies on Moving through Spaces, Touching Surfaces, Listening to Sounds Reverberating (Or Not), Smelling Materials and the Captive Air, and Feeling with Ones Body the Ambiances of the Places created.’, , http://isparchitecture.wordpress.com/2010/05/23/simulation-and-architecture/, Jenefer Robinson, ‘Simulation and architecture’, As part of nature, we might employ aesthetic models of appreciation suited to natural beauty. As hybrid objects, the aesthetic foci of ruins often exists in the interesting and unplanned interplay between the artefactual and the natural. For example, in a ruin, a support beam that was once hidden from view might now be exposed to the viewer. Or we might see nature slowly overwhelming a grand structure, as is the case with some temples at Angkor Wat. However, non-ruinated, merely shoddy structures which, by virtue of their faulty construction, show their support structures or are badly situated with the landscape are not seen as beautiful. The ruin reveals, whereas the shoddy structure merely shows. By contrast, the type of aesthetic appreciation we employ when engaging with photographs is more akin to traditional models of art appreciation; These Tours Provide the Origin of the Term ‘slumming.’, , For an academic account of this phenomenon; Ross, E., (2007) Slum Travelers: Ladies and London Poverty, pp. 1860-1920. , (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Such tours were often self-directed using guidebooks. Later in the century, Jacob Riis’ photographic book of slum pictures, How the Other Half Lives, shocked readers and was a catalyst for societal reforms; Riis, J., (2004) How the Other Half Lives: Studies among the Tenements of New York, , Whitefish, MT: Kessinger Publishing; Between one-fifth and one-quarter of all tourists who visit South Africa take a slum tour. This is the equivalent to 300-400,000 tourists a year; Melik, J., Slum tourism: Patronizing or social enlightenment? (2012) BBC World, p. 24; Recent tours have also sprung up in Kenya and Uganda; Mutiga, M., (2014) Ending “poorism, , Kenya’, New York Times; http://www.realitytoursandtravel.com/; Tourists say they want to see something different from what they see in their own, everyday lives, which in most cases is either over-the-top opulence (e.g. Versailles) or abject poverty, as found in these poverty tours. Much tourism revolves around the ‘authenticity’ of such places. The authenticity of such tourist attractions is an interesting subject, but is outside the scope of this article; Gentleman, A., Slum tours: A day trip too far? (2006) The Guardian, p. 6; http://www.forbes.com/sites/morganhartley/2013/05/24/cambodias-booming-new-industry-orphanage-tourism/, This seems especially true of the poverty tours that engage with children. Tours of slums with many children are unfortunately ubiquitous in developing countries. In South East Asia orphanage tours have become such a problem that government funded mass media campaigns have be launched with the goal of eradicate this sort of tourism. For example, the Cambodian government produces posters that ask people to refrain from participating in tours of orphanages. One particularly arresting poster reads, ‘Children are not tourist attractions: think before visiting an orphanage; Voyeurism is a non-consequentialist concern insofar as the moral badness of the act cannot be spelled out in terms of benefits, burdens, or the maximisation of either; Loftus, M., (2009) Slum Tours: Real Or Real Tacky?, , National Geographic Traveler; Gentleman, A., ‘Slum tours: A day trip too far?’ The Guardian 6 May 2006. Some tours do a better job of managing worries of voyeurism than others. I will describe how they do so in Section 4; Melik, J., (2012) Slum Tourism: Patronizing Or Social Enlightenment?, , BBC World; Mutiga, M., (2014) Ending “poorism, , Kenya’, New York Times; Sample, R.J., (2003) Exploitation: What It is and Why It’s Wrong, p. 17. , (New York: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc; For Wertheimer, neither are harm, unequal distribution of goods, or unequal bargaining power are necessary for exploitation; (1979), 36 (183). , There are (American and British) legal precedents for characterising exploitation in this way. One such case involved a rent-to-own scheme for a television where the prosecutor successfully argued that paying this non-standard price was a form of exploitation (Murphy v. McNamara, 416 A.2d 170; Wertheimer, A., (1996) Exploitation, p. 230. , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Wertheimer, A., (1996) Exploitation, p. 232. , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Goodin, R., offers an explicitly consequentialist theory of exploitation that claims that exploitation exists in the self-interested advantage one gets by interacting with vulnerable others. He argues that in cases of exploitation, the duty to protect vulnerable others is breached. Goodin believes we exploit others when we take advantage of the fact that the other is incompetent, has renounced strategic bargaining, or is grossly outmatched. In these situations we recognise or should recognise that the other is vulnerable. To protect the vulnerable Goodin believes we must not abuse our power over them, and we must shield them from the ‘predations’ of others; Goodin, R., (1985) Protecting the Vulnerable: A Reanalysis of Our Social Responsibilities, p. 36. , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; While Sample asserts that her account is not explicitly Kantian, I think it is. However, arguing for such is outside the scope of this article; The type of respect Sample writes of reflects Darwall’s concept of ‘moral recognition respect’ (not appraisal respect), where a member of the moral community is owed such respect by virtue of being the sort of creature who is part of the moral community; Darwall, S., Two kinds of respect (1977) Ethics, 88, pp. 36-49; , p. 57. , The type of respect Sample writes of reflects Darwall’s concept of ‘moral recognition respect’ (not appraisal respect), where a member of the moral community is owed such respect by virtue of being the sort of creature who is part of the moral community; , p. 75. , The type of respect Sample writes of reflects Darwall’s concept of ‘moral recognition respect’ (not appraisal respect), where a member of the moral community is owed such respect by virtue of being the sort of creature who is part of the moral community; primary goods are things that ‘every rational man is presumed to want.’ These include ‘social’ primary goods such as rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, income and wealth, and least of which is the social basis of self-respect. They also include ‘natural’ primary goods such as health and vigor, intelligence and imagination; Rawls, J., (1971) A Theory of Justice, p. 62. , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; ‘capabilities approach’ in which she defines capabilities as the ‘basic powers of choice that make a moral claim for opportunities to be realised and to flourish; Nussbaum, M., (2000) Women and Human Development: The Capabilities Approach, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, A list of Nussbaumian capabilities are: life (to have a normal life span); bodily integrity; sense, imagination, thought; emotions; practical reason; affiliation; interaction with other species; play; and political and material control over one’s environment; Martha, C., Nussbaum, M., (1999) Sex and Social Justice, pp. 41-42. , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Sen, A., believes in the importance of freedom, which is instrumental to and constitutive of a good life. He lists different sorts of freedoms that are necessary for this good life, including: political freedoms, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparencies of government, and protective security. His account obviously focuses on the political realm (as do Nussbaum’s and Rawls’); The worry here is that if all that is required to get rid of exploitation is money, we could still engage in poverty tourism and voyeurism as long as the funds provided went to a worthy cause. I think even if the funds went to a cause which attempted to help people in poverty to flourish, worries of voyeuristic exploitation remain; , p. 57. , The type of respect Sample writes of reflects Darwall’s concept of ‘moral recognition respect’ (not appraisal respect), where a member of the moral community is owed such respect by virtue of being the sort of creature who is part of the moral community; It is a commonplace of artistic theory (Ruskin’s, for example) that anything can be made beautiful by seeing it one way rather than another. However, many aestheticians still believe that there are more or less compassionate ways to portray your subject; Arbus, W.D., Photographs People Who have Atypical Bodies Or Clothing, Her Photographs are Often Considered Beautiful because of the Humility and Beauty She Imparts in Her Portraits. She Illuminates the Beauty Often Overlooked in Marginalised People, , rather than exploiting the foibles of the ‘fugly’; One may ask if there is voyeurism in all tours, whether slum or not. Is it morally problematic for us to gawk at people walking to work while on a city tour of Washington DC? I think worries of exploitative voyeurism could still hold. For example, my friend owned a brownstone in the Georgetown neighbourhood of Washington DC that just happened to be on a popular walking tour. Every morning he was faced with onlookers peering through his kitchen window to find him eating his morning cereal. In this situation something has gone awry. By buying this house my friend did not agree to give up his privacy. He is an injured third party in this situation, and the tourist are doing something morally inappropriate by peering into a private citizen’s house (in fact UNESCO has discussed this very issue in their ‘Hoi An Protocol’, which states that tours must respect the privacy of those living and working inside historic buildings.) However, I think that most of us can see that the exploitation occurring in this situation is not as traumatic as in the poverty tour case. Why? Perhaps it is because my friend had a choice to move, and therefore isn’t as vulnerable as those who don’t have the choice. Exploitation, I believe, exists along a continuum; it comes in degrees; This interpretation follows from an example Sample uses in her book. She states that the factory owner, if he makes little profit and is doing the best he can by his workers, is not exploiting them if he pays them low wages. He is trying to contribute to their flourishing. However, if the factory owner makes a huge profit and is neglectful of how his stingy wages affect the flourishing of his employees, then he is exploiting them (The type of respect Sample writes of reflects; Concept of ‘moral Recognition respect’, p. 89. , (not appraisal respect), where a member of the moral community is owed such respect by virtue of being the sort of creature who is part of the moral communityp; We used to look at people from ‘far away lands’ in literal zoo setting. For more on this phenomenon; Blanchard, P., Bancel, N., Deroo, E., (2009) Human Zoos: Science and Spectacle in the Age of Empire, , (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, Some of these ‘cultural festivals’ happened under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution on the National Mall; Swanson, J., (2011) The Pros and Cons of Slum Tourism, , CNN Travel; The researcher’s questionnaire asks people to choose one word of pairs such as happy/sad, harmony/ disharmony, modern/traditional. They ask people to take the survey before and after going on the tour of various townships in South Africa. They found that people had a more favourable opinion of the location and people after the tours; Rolfes, M., Poverty tourism: Theoretical reflections and empirical findings regarding an extraordinary form of tourism (2010) Geojournal, 75 (5), pp. 421-442; Lancaster, J., Next stop, squalor (2007) Smithsonian Magazine; Perhaps part of the reason these tours serve as opportunities for photographs more than opportunities for education is because of a lack of: 1 signage along the tour; 2) the history is so new that people don’t feel the need for a history lesson; Leary, J.P., (2011) Detroitism, , Guernica; A Magazine of Art & Politics; https://roadtrippers.com/blog/urban-exploration-tours-bringing-droves-of-tourists-to-detroit-ruins; https://www.facebook.com/ParkerCreativePhotography; http://motorcityphotoworkshops.com/MCPW/beautifying-blight-with-mcpw/; Although Lonely Planet has since removed information about ruin tours from its website, its 2011 guide lists such tours; Leary, J.P., (2011) Detroitism, , Guernica; A Magazine of Art & Politics; Leary, J.P., (2011) Detroitism, , Guernica; A Magazine of Art & Politics, bold my emphasis; Leary, J.P., (2011) Detroitism, , Guernica; A Magazine of Art & Politics; Morton, T., (2009) Something, Something, Something, Detroit: Lazy Journalists Love Pictures of Abandoned Stuff, , Vice; Leary, J.P., (2011) Detroitism, , Guernica; A Magazine of Art & Politics; Klein, A.S., (2011) Poverty is So Photogenic, , on Splicetoday.com; O’Hagan, S., (2011) Detroit in Ruins: The Photographs of Yves Marchand and Romain Meffre, , The Observer; Rosenberg, E., (2011) Motown Or Ghostown?

For example Meffre and Marchand’s The Ruins of Detroit is a photographic coffee table book. The photos are accompanied by a brief essay by; Thomas, J., Sugrue Who Cites Capitalism and the Decline of the Auto Industry as the Cause of Detroit’s Decline; Very Few Americans See Detroit as a Tourist Destination, , http://www.heidelberg.org, However, the Heidelberg Project claims to receive 275,000 discrete visitors a year; Morton, T., ‘Something, Something, Something, Detroit: Lazy (2009) Journalists Love Pictures of Abandoned Stuff’ Vice; Leary, J.P., (2011) Detroitism, , http://www.responsibletourismpartnership.org/CapeTown.html, Guernica; A Magazine of Art & Politics January; Elsewhere I have argued that communities should have the option to label such structures ruins. A ruin only remains so if it is left to decay. I think Detroiters should decide whether to allow local structures to ruinate, and whether to allow photographic tours of such places. Of course, ruin stabilisation (shoring up the structures just enough to make them approachable with endangering human life) would be necessary for such tours to exist; Hay, C., The obligation to resist oppression (2011) Journal of Social Philosophy, 42, pp. 21-45},

abstract={Why do some consumers find a consumption activity appealing while others see it as morally appalling? A series of five experiments in two different morally ambiguous contexts shows that differences in social identity strength can in part explain discrepant reactions to the very same consumption experience. Consumers who identify weakly (vs. strongly) with the people most related to the consumption environment are less likely to question the experience on moral grounds. As a result, they are more likely to choose a morally ambiguous consumption experience or to act in a morally ambiguous manner. The impact of social identity strength on consumer preference vanishes when the consumption experience is morally neutral or when all consumers are prompted to judge the experience on moral grounds. Statistical analyses based on post hoc justifications provide further evidence for the mediating role of moral considerations. © 2017 Society for Consumer Psychology},

abstract={Since 2012, there has been a significant growth in tourism in inner city Johannesburg. Some of this tourism materialises as walking tours in disadvantaged and relatively poor inner city neighbourhoods, some of which were until recently considered no-go areas. In a paper published in Urban Forum in 2014 (Frenzel 2014), I have analysed this new phenomenon in the context of slum tourism. I define slum tourism as such forms of tourism where poverty and associated signifiers become central themes and (part of the) attraction of the visited destination. Following a broad empirical research project, Hoogendoorn and Giddy (2017) have questioned whether the concept slum tourism should be used when discussing tourism in inner city Johannesburg. This paper forms a response to the paper of Hoogendoorn and Giddy (2017). © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Film tourism encompasses visits to places whose attractiveness is related to audio-visual products (films, tv-series, soap operas⋯). There is a wide range of studies acknowledging those products' potential to influence destination image, visit motivations, and, consequently, tourist arrivals to the depicted places. Destination managers and tourism entrepreneurs have increasingly made efforts to capitalise on this potential. In academia, the phenomenon has motivated a growing body of work on the relationship between cinema and tourism. The literature suggests that even films that portray destinations under a bad light can increase motivations to visit them. Such conclusions, strengthened by several real-world cases, imply that films might play a special role in inducing motivations for slum tourism, which is described as tourism to which poverty is part of the attraction. Slum tourism has received little academic attention from the perspective of tourism studies, and research on film tourists' motivations is particularly scarce. The few indications available in the literature are either initial insights or assumptions and premises subjectively made by their authors. In this context, the present study aims at developing a model including the dimensions of slum tourism motivations, and the film elements that act as their determinants. To this end, an exploratory, qualitative approach was employed, based on the empirical data collected with the participation of tourists visiting the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Results show that slum tourism motivations include Learning motivations and Experiential motivations as push factors, and that each of those dimensions is affected by two categories of film pull factors: Place & Personality, and Performance. The model is expected to work as an innovative tool for increasing destination attractiveness, and the effectiveness of managerial practices. In addition, it constitutes a first step towards a structural analysis of slum tourism motivations and their film determinants. The present investigation thus provides relevant theoretical and managerial insights, as well as important avenues for future research. © 2018 Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE.

abstract={In this review article, Rodanthi Tzanelli notes that (today) "slum," "favela," or "township" tourism (i.e., visitations to urban sites of squalor and poverty for leisure, education, or philanthropy) has evolved into a mobility trend worthy of dedicated study by tourism scholars. She signposts relevant contemporary studies and arguments on the subject by focusing upon the ways in which slum tourist "motivations" are structured socially and culturally at transcultural, international levels and not just as localized or individualized preferences. As a result, this review article taps into issues of capitalist demand and supply of exotic poverty and otherness. Tzanelli's aim is to highlight the social scientific traditions on which present dominant arguments on tourism supply and motivation are constructed, so as to shed light on the underlying norms and values by which the overall study area is informed. To this end, she discusses how different analytical modes connect to specific "gazes" or styles of study of slum tourism, which are by turn informed by particular epistemological frameworks. In her view, such epistemologies produce different versions of reality about slums that circulate in intellectual and policy networks. © 2018 Cognizant, LLC.},

abstract={Mumbai's Dharavi slum occupies a plot half the size of Central Park. It is home to one million people, with almost half of residents living in spaces under 10 m2, making it over six times as dense as daytime Manhattan. Using ethnographic fieldwork and online analysis, this article examines slum tourism and the perceptions and experiences of western visitors. Local tour operators emphasize the productivity of the slum, with its annual turnover of $665 million generated from its hutment industries. Its poor sanitation, lack of clean water, squalid conditions and overcrowding are ignored and replaced by a vision of resourcefulness, hard work and diligence. This presentation of the slum as a hive of industry is so successful that visitors overlook, or even deny, its obvious poverty. Dharavi is instead perceived as a manufacturing hub and retail experience; and in some cases even romanticized as a model of contentment and neighbourliness, with western visitors transformed by ‘life-changing’, ‘eye-opening’ and ‘mind-blowing’ experiences. This article concludes that the potential of slum tours as a form of international development is limited, as they enable wealthy middle-class westerners to feel ‘inspired’, ‘uplifted’ and ‘enriched’, but with little understanding of the need for change. © 2017 The Author},

abstract={Slum tourism is becoming increasingly popular in cities throughout the global South. South Africa has long been a township/slum tourism destination due to the inequalities caused by apartheid. During the later apartheid years and after the fall of apartheid in 1994, the once upmarket financial centre of inner city Johannesburg took a major economic downturn and has since been considered by many a ‘no-go zone’. Since 2012, a number of tour operators have begun to develop walking tours taking visitors into the inner city of Johannesburg. Some research has argued that tourism in Johannesburg’s inner city is a form of slum tourism. However, we argue that the inner city of Johannesburg is diverse, vast and complex, and therefore these walking tours should not necessarily be grouped with the concept of slum tourism. The research to justify this argument is multifaceted. First, definitions of slum tourism are explored against the backdrop of the Johannesburg inner city. Second, in-depth interviews were conducted with five tour operators that run inner city walking tours. Finally, 100 tourists were surveyed to determine their perceptions of inner city Johannesburg and whether or not they consider it to be a slum. The results demonstrate that although some commonalities exist between slum tourism and inner city walking tours, particularly the goal of de-stigmatisation, walking tours in the Johannesburg inner city should, arguably, not be considered a form of slum tourism. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={This chapter discusses the problem of poverty as something finely integrated in dark tourism. Though originally, both concepts sound very distant, no less true is that dark tourism and slum tourism are inextricably intertwined. Throughout this chapter review, we placed a hot debate on the role of globalization as a chief agent oriented to connect dissimilar economies into an all-encompassing system. The question whether tourism should be considered ethical or not still remains open. In days of Thana-Capitalism the suffering pivoted as the main commodity not only that helps structuring social institutions, but the necessary mediator between laypeople and their states. © 2018, IGI Global.

abstract={Slum tourism is on the rise globally (Steinbrink et al. 2012; Frenzel and Koens 2012). As a leisure practice, it can be defined in narrow terms as organised visits and guided tours in areas of urban poverty. More broadly, slum tourism can include the provision of hospitality as well as a range of other services (for example, capoeira classes or bungee jumping) in slums. Finally-in the broadest sense-slum tourism can been understood as the temporal visit to slums of people who normally reside outside slums. This includes (1) former slum dwellers returning for nostalgia reasons or for visits to family and friends and (2) volunteers and professionals in business, state or non-state public services. One must keep in mind the widest definition (perhaps more aptly covered by the term ‘slum mobilities’) when studying and reflecting on the phenomenon of leisurely slum tourism in a more narrow sense (tourists touring the slum) because the mobile practices and differently themed visits tend to influence each other. Also, conceptual boundaries are often blurred and subject to negotiation and change. Moreover, slum tourism appears to be a dynamic and developing system, adapting to local specific conditions as well as following global trends. © 2014 Taylor and Francis. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The present chapter discusses to what extent the rise of new risks and dangers, modernity has brought, has causing the end of tourism. The answer to the above formulated questions is not easy, and of course, it exhibits a fertile ground to be explored in other approaches. The ceaseless news about violence, cruelty, wars and deaths have serious negative impacts on audience worldwide. Though policy makers have devoted their time and efforts in looking for new alternative segments where death replaces the allegory of beautiness, giving as a result new products as dark-tourism, slum-tourism, disaster-tourism or doom-tourism, other problems arise. The curiosity for tourists in visiting spaces of mass death or extreme suffering contradicts not only its nature as a mechanism of revitalization and relaxes but may very well lead to narcissism which in fact is the end of tourism. © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={Since the 1990’s, Rocinha has been securing itself as a paradigm of touristic favela based on a model centered in the action of private companies outside the favela and in the indifference of the government. This article analyzes the practical and the discursive inflections which permitted the end of this paradigm and the emergence of a model based on public and private partnerships as well as in the organization of the local residents as entrepreneurs. Through field research and interviews, the perceptions and the justifications of these agents involved in the transformation of Santa Marta in a tourist attraction (the public sphere, tourism agencies, local residents) were examined. The hypothesis advocated here is that the Santa Marta, the first favela with a Pacifying Police Unit, offers a privileged point to observe the new power networks that defines the place to be occupied by the favelas in a project which makes Rio de Janeiro a postcard city. © 2017, EDUFBA - Editora Universttaria.

abstract={This article examines depictions of the relationships between antebellum Irish and African-American residents in a particular space - the notorious, impoverished New York neighborhood called Five Points - from a spatial and performance perspective. In descriptions of this destitute area, journalists, reformers, and writers of sensation narratives portrayed spaces where black and white New Yorkers lived together as evidence of the depravity they associated with both poverty and ‘amalgamation’. Contestations over sharing this space took many performative forms as black and Irish residents experienced riotous mob violence in the streets, socialized in underground saloons, competed in dancing contests, and were the object of minstrelized enactments, while bourgeois voyeuristic spectators were drawn to Five Points streets and stages as ‘slum tourists’. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The visit of the favela or slum into a tourist destination is seen as a part of the so-called reality toursphenomenon and of the global circulation of the favela as a trademark. Tourist behaviour involves asearch for leisure experiences from interactions with features or characteristics of places they chooseto visit. Examples are the favelas in Brazil, the township of South Africa, the slum in India that have ledto different definitions of "slum tourism", "poor-poor tourism", "reality tourism". Web heavily affecttoday most of the online activities and their effect on tourism is obviously rather important. The aim ofthe chapter is to discuss about slum tourism definitions. At the same time, taking Reality Tours and Travel- a wholesaler slum websites - as a case, this study attempts to explore issues of the quality of strategicchoices on the web. Considering that the content of web site includes a wide variety of technologies, isimportant that website offer also interactivity with e-tourists. Through the results of the study, it is possibleto gain knowledge of the slum e-tourism. © 2016 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper examines the role of social media as a conduit for tourist reflexivity. The rationale arises from the realisation that existing research has so far failed to recognise fully, in a sociocultural sense, the tourist as a reflexive agent. Taking a novel 'humanist' netnographic orientation, layered with a semi-autonetnographic voice, the paper mobilises the example of slum tourism, to examine tourist reflexivity as it is evident in social media space. The reflexive (slum) tourist emerges as exhibiting three capabilities: interrogating personal misconceptions and allowing self-transformation; embracing ambivalence, complexity and uncertainty; and, critiquing own and others' tourism behaviours. Interestingly, in this sense, tourists opt to self-review in product review sites. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Modern slum tourism, rooted in the social justice movements of South Africa and Brazil in the early 1990s, has become an increasingly popular practice among tourists looking for experiences off the beaten path. Unsurprisingly, a form of tourism that allows wealthy travelers to experience the "reality" of how poor people live has elicited criticism and controversy. Slum tourism has been lauded as an innovative economic opportunity for poor urban neighborhoods and has been condemned for promoting poverty voyeurism. The first author undertook a critical discourse analysis in the winter of 2013-2014, analyzing slum tourism discourse in travel blogs. Eighteen travel blogs and 36 blogs postings were analyzed using a Foucauldian critical discourse perspective. The study found that travel bloggers use a number of structures of authority and structures of responsibility to convince their readers of the value of this touristic practice and the integrity of the travelers who would choose to participate in slum tourism. © 2016 Cognizant, LLC.},

abstract={Supporting the development of small tourism businesses has been seen by policy-makers as a valuable means of alleviating poverty in South African townships. This perspective has been endorsed by several “responsible” tourism businesses and academics. Following a literature review, this paper reports the findings of an empirical study that examined the practices of 80 micro-business owners and the factors that shape their behaviour in two South African townships. In spite of significant visitor numbers, it finds that their narrow social networks, the imbalances of power between them and intermediaries such as travel agencies and tour operators, ideas of Ubuntu and Umona, and complex family and ethnic ties all represent barriers that prevent them from developing their businesses and sharing in the material gains available through tourism. This analysis has important implications for local policy-makers and those advocating responsible tourism. For the former, it suggests a cessation of current initiatives in favour of greater regulation and alternative forms of investment. For the latter, it implies a need to reassess the utility of advocating responsible tourism to consumers in a context where they do not understand the dynamics which fashion what is on offer or the implications of their choices. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In recent times, slum tourism has become one of the fastest growing niche tourism segments in the world. The favela, slum, township, gecekondu appear into a tourist destination as part of the so-called reality tour phenomenon. In the tourist sector, the web plays an important role. In fact, consumer choices are aided by information picked up through the internet, which is an ideal place to communicate, promote and sell destinations and where potential travellers can undertake comparisons and choices more responsibly. This paper evaluates tour whole sales websites to analyse different types of strategic choices. The websites are evaluated using an extended Model of Internet Commerce Adoption (eMICA) methodological approach that draws on the evolutionary development of electronic commerce. Considering that internet includes a wide variety of technologies, which could bring potential benefits and reach new customers, it is important that website information is complete and attractive. The following study is of an exploratory nature. Through the results of the study, it is possible to gain knowledge of the slum e-tourism. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Slum tourism is an expanding domain of research focused on organized tours to poorer areas of cities in the global South, such as South Africa's urban townships. The aim is to contribute towards a reframing of scholarship on slum tourism by directing attention to the phenomenon of tourism development occurring in rural slums or poverty areas of South Africa, namely the former rural Bantustan or Homeland areas. These rural areas are presently the focus of government attention for tourism promotion as part of economic upgrading and employment creation. The key findings are that the expanding tourism economy of these rural slumlands is dominated by domestic tourists rather than international visitors with most tourists engaged in VFR travel including trips to rural second homes. In addition, these areas are important foci for religious pilgrimage. In terms of international scholarship on slum tourism the paper offers the significant observation that the largest share of tourists originate in the country's urban township areas which are the attractions for international slum tourists. The destinations for visits by international slum tourists are therefore the essential source regions of tourists for visits to the rural poverty areas or slumlands of South Africa. This points to an imperative for broadening the research agenda of slum tourism to incorporate research which examines the tourism mobilities of ordinary residents of townships or favelas. © Bulletin of Geography.

abstract={Much attention has been paid to township tourism in South Africa, a practice of tourism that emerged in Apartheid South Africa with different organised tours catering for governmental officials, faith-based groups and anti-apartheid activists. In democratic South Africa, township tourism has developed into a mainstream tourism activity, and operators now offer township tours, township stays and other tourist activities in townships across rural and urban South Africa. Township tourism has also been one central empirical pillar of the relatively new research area of slum tourism, addressing tourism in slums and areas of relative urban poverty across the globe. Based on recent preliminary empirical research in Johannesburg, this paper shows that slum tourism can now also be observed in areas other than townships in South Africa, including perceived ‘no-go areas’ in inner-city Johannesburg. The expansion of slum tourism beyond townships in Johannesburg points to an increasingly complex picture of urban poverty in South Africa. It also allows reflections on the role of slum tourism in poverty alleviation and urban regeneration, responding to and addressing ‘territorial stigma’ and other related symbolic aspects of poverty. Analysing the motivations and perspectives of tour operators of some of these new tours, the paper finds that the new slum tourism in South Africa is pursued in order to serve as an urban development and regeneration tool from below. It responds to an absence of action or perceived failure to respond to poverty by urban policy, and its potential lies in particular in addressing invisibility, overcoming territorial stigma and empowerment of the urban poor. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={This article introduces a theme issue of Urban Forum on the topic of urban tourism in Africa. A context is provided for the issue by an overview of key themes which have been represented in a decade of African urban tourism research. Although most extant research is on urban South Africa, there is an emerging literature on other African cities. The major themes of research have surrounded tourism and urban economic restructuring with the establishment of new products for leisure tourism; slum tourism and pro-poor tourism; the role of the accommodation sector; African cities as non-leisure destinations; and, informal sector tourism. It is argued that within the evolving international scholarship on urban tourism, aspects of African urban tourism research exhibit distinctive features and offer challenges to Northern conceptions of urban tourism and urban tourists. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the contribution of informal settlements to a tourism strategy and to city branding. It takes the case of Medellin, Colombia, which in recent years has developed several projects in their barrios using a policy called: "social urbanism". Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a case study, that of "social urbanism" in Medellin, and the relationship with what is called slum tourism and city branding. After a brief theoretical exploration about informal settlements in Latin America, slum tourism and city branding; the paper presents the urban and social transformation of Medellin's dangerous and stigmatized barrios with the "social urbanism" policy. Then the relationship between social urbanism, informal settlements and city branding is discussed. Findings: Medellin, perhaps without noticing or anticipating, has found a role for informal settlements in branding the city, and promoting tourism to those areas. With "social urbanism", it is also helping to build an image of the city more authentic and distinguishable from other cities in Colombia and Latin America. Originality/value: The paper explores two themes that are considered nearly opposite: informal settlements and city branding. It discusses how a city in Colombia might have found a way to link them together with interesting results. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The paper examines the role of slum tourism in poverty relief. To do so, it surveys the state-of-the-art literature on tourism and poverty and investigates the ways in which slum tourism research relates to this literature. Slum tourism research has addressed the question of how the poor may benefit from this practice; however, these efforts have not systematically considered the general debate on tourism and poverty relief. The survey of slum tourism research also contributes to the conceptual development of the tourism-poverty nexus. The predominant choice of approaches in this field relies on quantitative indicators of poverty relief, but these donot sufficiently account for the multi- dimensional character of poverty. The study of slum tourism research points to the multi-dimensional valorisation of poverty in tourism which is an aspect often overlooked in the state-of-the-art research on tourism and poverty.},

abstract={Sightseeing in the poorest quarters of southern hemisphere cities has been observed occurring in Cape Town, Rio de Janeiro, Mumbai and many other cities. The increasing global interest in touring poor urban environments is accompanied by a strong morally charged debate; so far, this debate has not been critically addressed. This article avoids asking if slum tourism is good or bad, but instead seeks a second-order observation, i.e. to investigate under what conditions the social praxis of slum tourism is considered as good or bad, by processing information on esteem or disesteem among tourists and tour providers. Special attention is given to any relation between morality and place, and the thesis posited is that the moral charging of slum tourism is dependent on the presence of specific preconceived notions of slums and poverty. This shall be clarified by means of references to two empirical case studies carried out in (1) Cape Town in 2007 and 2008 and (2) Mumbai in 2009.},

abstract={In the last two decades, urban tourism shifted from a heritage-focused supply to a broader offer (Maitland and Newman 2009). While ‘traditional’ urban tourism was concentrated mainly in and around historic city centres, the diversification of urban tourism has integrated new quarters and areas previously ignored by visitors. As Hoffman explains ‘the differentiation of formerly standardized markets has valorized multiculturalism and diversity, giving rise to new forms of cultural capital and creating interest in formerly unattractive places’ (Hoffman 2003b: 92). The underlying idea of such policies was to develop disadvantaged areas and regenerate them through the creation of tourism activities (Zukin 1998), but also to demonstrate how inclusive and cosmopolitan a city can be (Shaw 2007). These developments concerned mainly former industrial areas and districts with a high rate of migrants shaping a city of quarters (Roodhouse 2006) allowing tourists to choose à la carte according to their interests. Myriad tourism assets could thus be created from art studios over fashion districts to ethnic markets and, in extreme cases, to slum tourism. So-called ‘ethnic quarters’ became in many cities an interesting asset for tourism authorities (Rath 2007). Chinese quarters, Little Italys or Little Indias were promoted as a means of encountering the exotic. Indeed, ethnic quarters represent enclaves with an extensive variety of linguistic, religious, family and friendship entities. On the one hand they play the role of important storehouses of heritage that are often in the process of disappearing in developing ‘home’ countries abroad (Smith and Maryann 2001). On the other hand they embody a melting pot of many different cultures, composed of locals, immigrants, residents and users (Chang 1999). Many ethnic quarters grew indeed through the settlement of migrant workers in impoverished areas with little or no urban planning. However, as soon as the community members could afford to settle in a wealthier area they left the district. What remained were the shops and specialised service providers offering specific cultural goods and providing the opportunity of social exchange and contacts with other community members. Very important in that context is the food and beverages supply for being often emphasised by the tourism promotion as clusters of exotic restaurants (Conforti 1996; Trevor and Monder 2003; Selby 2004). These commercial ethnic belts (McLaughlin and Jesilow, 1998) attract community members, allowing them to distinguish themselves from the host country for a limited time and reafirming their identities (Diekmann and Maulet 2009). However, the movement of people out of the district exacerbates the already problematic situation (dilapidated housing, high unemployment and high rates of crime) of the area. In fact, new migrants from other countries settle in the dilapidated area following the same path as their predecessors and generating a multicultural melting pot. Moreover, as highlighted by Hoffman, these areas are frequently characterised by a distinct “ghetto’ economy, social/spatial isolation and exclusion, negatively perceived culture, political patronage and social policies (Hoffman 2003b: 105). While Hoffman distinguishes this state as being a Fordist concept, it is indeed in many countries valid as long as regeneration has not been considered for the district under scrutiny. One regeneration process is tourism development. Yet, the type of development depends to a large extent on the geographical situation and connections to the main tourism clusters and urban spaces. The chapter examines the concept of ethnic tourism by highlighting the ambivalence in promoting specific cultural communities as exotic to the ‘tourist community’, and in that ‘excluding’ a whole group of (potential) consumers, that often constitute the majority of visitors. Findings from a recent survey led in the sub-Saharan African precinct Matonge in Brussels will highlight the signi?cance of community visitors. Moreover, the chapter will look into the promotional policies and how the tourism mediation shapes the communities and stakeholders in the development process, focusing on several examples. © 2013 Melanie Smith and Greg Richards.},

abstract={Slum tourism is a globalizing trend and a controversial form of tourism. Impoverished urban areas have always enticed the popular imagination, considered to be places of 'otherness', 'moral decay', 'deviant liberty' or 'authenticity'. 'Slumming' has a long tradition in the Global North, for example in Victorian London when the upper classes toured the East End. What is new, however, is its development dynamics and its rapidly spreading popularity across the globe. Township tourism and favela tourism have currently reached mass tourism characteristics in South Africa and in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In other countries of the Global South, slum tourism now also occurs and providers see huge growth potential. While the morally controversial practice of slum tourism has raised much attention and opinionated debates in the media for several years, academic research has only recently started addressing it as a global phenomenon. This edition provides the first systematic overview of the field and the diverse issues connected to slum tourism. This multidisciplinary collection is unique both in its conceptual and empirical breadth. Its chapters indicate that 'global slumming' is not merely a controversial and challenging topic in itself, but also offers an apt lens through which to discuss core concepts in critical tourism studies in a global perspective, in particular: 'poverty', 'power' and 'ethics'. Building on research by prolific researchers from ten different countries, the book provides a comprehensive and unique insight in the current empirical, practical and theoretical knowledge on the subject. It takes a thorough and critical review of issues associated with slum tourism, asking why slums are visited, whether they should be visited, how they are represented, who is benefiting from it and in what way. It offers new insights to tourism's role in poverty alleviation and urban regeneration, power relations in contact zones and tourism's cultural and political implications. Drawing on research from four continents and seven different countries, and from multidisciplinary perspectives, this ground-breaking volume will be valuable reading for students, researchers and academics interested in this contemporary form of tourism. © 2012 Fabian Frenzel, Ko Koens and Malte Steinbrink.},

abstract={The material cultures of domestic residential spaces are highly varied. As globalising processes unfold, domestic arenas are shaped by a variety of competing influences: traditional, informal, economic, and global. In urban Africa diverging trends are found. First, at the top of the housing market, a Western lifestyle and pattern of use of domestic space is common. Second, at the lower end of the housing market, domestic space is increasingly integrating income-generating activities. Examples abound where domestic space is affected by unusual combinations of internal and external processes. Thus, shack living has been noted as a fashion, whereby 'shack chic' has become a design style. © 2012 Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved..},

abstract={This paper aims to evaluate stakeholders' views on the potential role that slum tourism and its associated products can play in enhancing living conditions in slums in Egypt. Empirical results were obtained using two quantitative surveys: one to investigate dwellers' perceptions and a second to select appropriate pro-poor products based on stakeholders' preferences. Findings show that inhabitants have positive attitudes toward the possibility of benefiting from slum tourism, but they differed in their ranking of the appropriateness of related pro-poor products. Based on findings, authorities should develop appropriate slum tourism products and typologies, as a planning threshold, to enhance living conditions of dwellers. A useful planning way of drawing ties between slum types and typologies is presented. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This Exploration focuses on the emerging field of slum tourism research, which has the potential to connect Latin American and Caribbean studies on tourism and urban inequality. Slum tourism involves transforming poverty, squalor and violence into a tourism product. Drawing on both altruism and voyeurism, this form of tourism is a complex phenomenon that raises various questions concerning power, inequality and subjectivity. This essay seeks to advance the theoretical debate on slum tourism research and to stimulate comparative studies. Introducing brief examples of slum tourism in Mexico and Jamaica, this contribution moves towards an initial theorization of the performance, negotiation and transformation of inequality in a framework of tourism and global mobilities.},

abstract={This article draws attention to a controversial activity in poor urban neighborhoods. Slum tourism is a growing business worldwide and simultaneously it is a new form of encounter between the global South and the global North. Following the new mobilities paradigm, I investigate a particular form of slum tourism, which intertwines urban poverty and charity, representation and powerful imaginaries, tourist mobility and transnational lifestyles. This is the case in Mazatlán, Mexico, where a multidenominational church offers regular tours to the city's garbage dump. I scrutinize the various modes of (im)mobilities and their implications for peoples and places, interconnecting spheres which are conceived of as separate. In conclusion, I outline the ambiguous effects when marginalized spaces become integral parts of the urban representation. © 2012 Urban Research Publications Limited.},

abstract={This paper introduces the Special Issue on slum tourism with a reflection on the state of the art on this new area of tourism research. After a review of the literature we discuss the breadth of research that was presented at the conference 'Destination Slum', the first international conference on slum tourism. Identifying various dimensions, as well as similarities and differences, in slum tourism in different parts of the world, we contest that slum tourism has evolved from being practised at only a limited number of places into a truly global phenomenon which now is performed on five continents. Equally the variety of services and ways in which tourists visit the slums has increased.The widening scope and diversity of slum tourism is clearly reflected in the variety of papers presented at the conference and in this Special Issue. Whilst academic discussion on the theme is evolving rapidly, slum tourism is still a relatively young area of research. Most papers at the conference and, indeed, most slum tourism research as a whole appears to remain focused on understanding issues of representation, often concentrating on a reflection of slum tourists rather than tourism. Aspects, such as the position of local people, remain underexposed as well as empirical work on the actual practice of slum tourism. To address these issues, we set out a research agenda in the final part of the article with potential avenues for future research to further the knowledge on slum tourism. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Slum tourism in the Global South is a relatively new phenomenon. The tourist gaze at the poverty of the Others is long established, though. This paper is concerned with the genesis of urban poverty tourism. By placing the phenomenon of slumming in the wider realm of the social upheavals in Victorian London and early twentieth century USA, the historical review first explains its dependency on the social context determining its emergence and evolution. Secondly, slum tourism is shown to be adequately understood only if seen as part of modern city tourism. Thirdly, it is demonstrate that the culturalization of poverty attains special significance in slum tourism. Fourthly, the history of slum tourism is shown to have implications for understanding present-day slum tourism in the Global South, using South Africa as an example. The article is designed to be a first step towards understanding the conditions, forms and consequences of globalization of slum tourism and the process of constructing the global slum as a universal type of tourist destination. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This article examines how Dharavi is represented to, and interpreted by, tourists participating in walking tours around Mumbai's largest slum. Across the world 'the slum' is positioned as space more authentic and realistic than the artifice of the concrete cityscape, as demonstrated by the recent fascination surrounding 'Slumdog Millionaire'. By first exploring the complex geography and history of Dharavi, this article lays the foundation for arguing that any representation of this place can only ever be subjective, conditional and uncertain. Through interviews and surveys with tour guides, tour-goers and slum dwellers this article evaluates how Dharavi is represented by 'Reality Tours and Travel', and how its message is interpreted by their tour-goers. It becomes clear these tours do have a capacity to change negative perceptions about slums, albeit in a highly individualized context. The article concludes that the tour partially achieves its transformative aims, although its ability to alter any negative images of slums remains restricted by the very techniques it uses to position Dharavi as a place of archetypal 'reality'. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This article explores a tour to the garbage dump in the city of Mazatlán, northern Mexico, as an alternative to mass tourism. The tour, conducted by an evangelical North American church, is conceptualized as a non-profit, eye-opening experience for affluent tourists. I frame the tour as a particular kind of slum tourism, which is embedded in Christian values and promises a meaningful tourist experience by helping the poor. Drawing on an ethnographic approach, I argue that the interplay of globalization processes and local conditions in Mazatlán produces a particular framework in which slum tours emerge and work. The analysis reveals that this tour is a consequence of revised forms of tourism, transnational lifestyles and global forces at work in the North American-Mexican relationships. I stress that research needs to draw further attention to slum tourism's positioning in wider structural and historical contexts in order to understand its idiosyncratic features. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This paper explores the aesthetics and politics of slum tourism - what are the attractions and what are the dangers of aestheticizing poverty? We first present eleven images of slums and informal urbanism in south and Southeast Asia and suggest a complex mix of attractions for Western tourists. On the one hand informal urbanism can be picturesque with elements of nostalgia and a quest for authenticity; on the other is the shock of the real, the spectacle of intensive labyrinthine urbanity and an uneasy voyeurism. We suggest the attraction is more the anxious and awe-filled pleasure of the sublime than any formal beauty. The paper then changes scale to connect such imagery to the political economy and geography of the city where the visibility of slums and urban informality is linked to state and market ideologies. Informal settlements generally have negative symbolic and political capital; the developing state paradoxically needs tourists yet seeks to control the urban image for purposes of branding and to signify law and order. The slum is often hidden from the public gaze in a manner that is complicit with the reproduction of poverty. While the voyeuristic gaze of the Western tourist produces an aestheticization of poverty this does not depoliticize so much as it opens up new connections and potential transformations. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This article examines the transvaluation of urban poverty in neo-liberal India through a reading of Endemol's reality television show The Big Switch (Season One, UTV Bindass, 2009). Formatted as Survivor for Indian D-list celebrities and Extreme Makeover for Mumbai's slum dwellers, who were then teamed together in a simulated slum, the show promised to make one out of ten 'slumdogs' a millionaire. Paying attention to the quick fix that reality television provides to the shortage of living space, I frame my critique of the Switch House within what A. Appadurai calls Mumbai's Great Housing Dream and what Michel Foucault has defined as heterotopia. I propose that The Big Switch (Hitesh Bhatia, 2009), as it stages the fantasy of millionairedom and celebrityhood for all, becomes a symptom of the antagonisms between global corporate formalism and the informal street economy at the heart of the illegal slum city. I situate the television text within the larger history of the Indian television industry, as well as the current turn towards 'slum culture' in global reality-based television programming, especially through shows like Famous, Rich, and In the Slums (Joyce Trozzo, 2011) and Slumdog Secret Millionaire (Rod Williams, 2010). Building on the media urbanism theory of Ravi Sundaram, I also suggest that a material analysis of the TV set in the slum is important in articulating the specificities of slum citizenship and spectatorship. I argue that slum tourism (and its visual capture in photography, cinema and television) is not only an archive of the ephemeral kinetic city but of an illegal yet necessary dwelling in constant threat of demolition, whose moment of exhibition to the world cannot be separated from the moment of its destruction by that world. © 2012 Intellect Ltd Article.

abstract={The paper seeks to contribute to the recent slum tourism-debate. On the basis of an empirical field study conducted in Mumbai in 2009, this article investigates how Indian slums are observed by different actors within the communication context of this (emerging) form of tourism. Taking into consideration that slums are defined in public discourse nearly exclusively by poverty and sordidness, it is interesting to examine how the tour agency's objective of correcting the negative connotations of poverty is achieved. Accordingly, the study aims, by means of a second order observation, to observe how the tourists and the tour agency simultaneously perceive and charge poverty. Following the epistemological premise that reality is an observer-dependent construction, it seeks to outline which different images or realities of the investigated slum, Dharavi, are created by the different observations. The findings will then facilitate a discussion of the extent to which poverty can be defined as the dominant mode of observation of the slum tourism context as a whole. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Rocinha is the paradigmatic touristic favela, with tours taking place regularly since the early 1990s and with 3,500 tourists visiting the site each month. What do the inhabitants of Rocinha think about these tourists and their cameras? Do they perceive this presence as something that humiliates and objectifies them or as a possibility of empowerment? The methodology included different strategies: field observation, participant observation in different tours, long interviews with qualified informants and semistructured interviews with 175 inhabitants from Rocinha. The article concludes that between the total approval of and unconditional disagreement towards the touristic practices, there are some nuances which should be carefully examined.},
