abstract={Recent news about Colonial Williamsburg outsourcing the management of its for-profit business entities has inspired questions about the museum's original intent and how it should shape the institution's future. This article offers a fresh look at the institution's founding, and argues that the original idea for the museum was far spookier than researchers have acknowledged. In fact, elements of the uncanny, from ghost stories to talk of spirits and time travel, have been present in nearly all of the foundation's innovative historical interpretation since the 1930s. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.

abstract={Dark Tourism in Baguio City has been gaining a lot of attention from those who seek the grim and haunted. Tourists are fond of the ghost stories and the paranormal activities that have been told about certain sites while locals are engaged to dreaded stimulation experiences without knowing the shadowed past behind it. The purpose of this study is to gather data on how dark tourism sites, as a `pull' factor to tourists, have impacted Baguio City as a whole; including the municipality, the people under its governance, and it's out-turn to the lives of the residents. Researchers have yet to investigate how to deal with the growing number of tourists visiting the locality, and apprehend the variables stated in this research. The design used for this study is descriptive, quantitative research. Non-probability, convenience sampling was used since this is the rational choice for cases where identifying all members of a population is impossible (De Vos, 1998). Questionnaires were distributed to residents aged twenty (20) years old and above. The respondents were ninety (90) residents who are staying nearby dark tourism sites, having their perceptions about the impacts of dark tourism in the area. Based on the findings, residents perceived the benefits of dark tourism in Baguio city as highly beneficial. It also concludes that Baguio city residents experience positive outcomes from tourism. © 2019, University of Aveiro. All rights reserved.},

abstract={It may be categorically unpleasant to visit cemeteries, crash sites, and death camps, but tourists queue up to see such places. Scholars have been attempting to explain this fascination with the macabre and morbid since the mid-1990s. Early analyses of dark tourism highlighted the modern and postmodern motivations underlying this novel form of travel. As a result, much of the subsequent work on this phenomenon has concentrated on contemporary visits to modern sites such as Auschwitz or Chernobyl. Yet, it is undeniable that ancient trips to the Roman Colosseum and medieval pilgrimages to locations of martyrdom had dark undertones, as many have noted. This round table discussion draws together five scholars to consider how a variety of forces have fuelled dark tourism in the past. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Since the final third of the twentieth century, sites related to painful or traumatic memories have developed tourism strategies that have, in more than one case, turned them into primary tourist attractions. This article conducts a theoretical study that examines and presents the main analytical paradigms developed at the academic level for research on tourism in places that have witnessed traumatic events. Due to their academic importance and relative media presence, Dark tourism, Thanatourism and Memorial tourism, are more prevalent than other theoretical and analytical approaches. Some of the problems arising from the processes of turning traumatic memory into a tourist attraction are also examined, taking as a case study the memory of the Holocaust and its reference site, the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial. The article concludes that there is a need to continue reflecting on these debates, since they present a complexity that augurs a long journey that will surely continue to provide academia with contributions that define the role of different paradigms. © 2018 Universidad de Alicante - Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones TurÃ­sticas.

abstract={In the context of the huge diversification in the field of cultural heritage, there are nowadays many touristic places whose main appeal lies in the connection with tragic events. Beyond the scope of cultural tourism, it may be confusing to classify them due to the extraordinary richness and heterogeneity of the different types of tourism as typified by tourism science. Thus, the scientific community uses several labels to name the tourism practices carried out in touristic places linked to tragedy. Among the many, it is worth pointing out dark tourism and memorial tourism, not only because of their undeniable academic impact, but also because of the media relevance gained. This article deals with the problems faced when it comes to determining the boundaries of what may be considered dark tourism or memorial tourism. After a comprehensive analysis of the theoretical contributions regarding both models, what is most relevant is why and in which contexts one term or the other is used. © 2018 Varna University of Management.

abstract={“Provides innovative and exciting insights into heritage identity, meaning, and belonging from a global perspective. A welcome addition to the growing heritage literature.”--Dallen J. Timothy, author of Cultural Heritage and Tourism: An Introduction “A critical collection of international heritage case studies that represents a wide range of issues and exemplifies its complexities and contradictions vividly.”--A. V. Seaton, coeditor of Slavery, Contested Heritage, and Thanatourism Bringing together high-profile cultural heritage sites from around the world, this volume shows how the term heritage has been used or understood by different groups of people over time. For some, heritage describes a celebration of a particular culture and history or a sense of identity, ownership, and belonging. However, for others it is frequently connected with social privilege and exclusion, made all the more complicated due to its relationship with the tourism industry. These case studies are taken from America, Britain, Ireland, France, Germany, Austria, India, China, and the Caribbean. The varied approaches to heritage range from the Nazi regime’s vision of German national history to the present-day push to recover Native American culture from outdated Hollywood portrayals. The contributors argue that heritage has a central yet sometimes problematic purpose: creating divisions, contesting identities, and constructing narratives of history that may not be seen as accurate by all. Exploring the benefits of cultural inheritance, this volume also acknowledges the ways that heritage operates in places with clashing viewpoints about what exactly that heritage represents. The essays argue that although heritage and tourism may help to alleviate poverty and create opportunity, they can also become a burden by compromising cultures and landscapes. Featuring a tribute to Sir Gregory Ashworth, whose influential work drew attention to the contested meanings of heritage, this volume illuminates a fascinating international debate. © 2018 by Glenn Hooper.

abstract={This paper reviews academic research into dark tourism and thanatourism over the 1996–2016 period. The aims of this paper are threefold. First, it reviews the evolution of the concepts of dark tourism and thanatourism, highlighting similarities and differences between them. Second it evaluates progress in 6 key themes and debates. These are: issues of the definition and scope of the concepts; ethical issues associated with such forms of tourism; the political and ideological dimensions of dark tourism and thanatourism; the nature of demand for places of death and suffering; the management of such places; and the methods of research used for investigating such tourism. Third, research gaps and issues that demand fuller scrutiny are identified. The paper argues that two decades of research have not convincingly demonstrated that dark tourism and thanatourism are distinct forms of tourism, and in many ways they appear to be little different from heritage tourism. © 2017 The Author},

abstract={Taking cues from the surging popularity of thana-tourism, this paper argues that its prevalence echoes the end days of capitalism. The predominant forms of tourism in a society reflect the ethos of that society. What we once called 'mass tourism' reflected the spirit of classical capitalism; later, ecotourism and various other alternative forms of tourism reflected a critical turn in capitalism, often called the 'sympathetic capitalism'. These were incremental alternations, however. Thanatourism is a qualitatively discontinuous form of tourism and its surge should thus correspond with a similarly discontinuous, radical, shift in capitalism. The authors present scholarly perspectives to bring home the view that thana-tourism might indeed be symptomatic of the end of capitalism. &copy 2018, IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This exploratory study examines experience engineering at select tourist sites of the D-Day landing area in Normandy, France. Using Holt’s 1995 typology of symbolic consumption as an interpretive frame, a number of significant museums, cemeteries, gun batteries, beaches and plinths were examined. Interactions with the public at these sites including the introspection of five academics were compiled, compared and interpreted. The experiences of D-Day visitors were then considered in relation to the range of consumption metaphors afforded by Holt’s model. The results are consistent with Holt’s explanation of symbolic consumption. These rich and nuanced examples of experiential consumption are typified by the four consumption metaphors of Holt’s model; namely, Experience, Integration, Play and Classification. By doing this the widespread practise, scale and techniques of experience engineering by site managers/curators is evident. The differing and inconsistent staged authenticity by stakeholders and curators invites implicational consideration. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The Lost Songs of St Kilda is an album of piano pieces reportedly taught to a Scottish mainlander by a St Kildan music teacher. The album comprises of piano recordings, performed by the mainlander, Trevor Morrison, together with orchestral arrangements of the pieces and was released in September 2016. It reached the top of the British classical music chart shortly after and became the fastest selling posthumously released debut album in British chart history. This paper explores how a contemporary recording of songs reportedly from St Kilda has captured the British fascination with a "remote" place and a "lost" island society in a manner that represents what might be termed "thana-islomania". The article will suggest that the contemporary recordings and the packaging of the album act in concert to create emotional geographies of St Kilda that are constructed in a mythical place-time, a "mythscape".},

abstract={This chapter discusses e-complaints about the death sites which emerge from visitors’ online reviews, and is useful for strengthening identity attributed to brand image. Smart reviews offer an interesting topic to be developed in the next years. Though a lot of investigation has centred on the rise and expansion of dark tourism, little attention was given to the role of e-complaints as a key factor in boosting or dampening the “attractiveness” of dark destinations. The authors also discuss, to what extent the perceived authenticity stated via e-reviews explains future behavioural intention in visiting the death sites. Finally, we aim to answer whether negative reviews of otherwise normal destinations, reviews that rouse feelings of horror, attract dark tourists. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={The purpose of this review article is first to reconstruct the main phases of the development of a new memorial landscape in Europe honoring the millions of victims of National Socialism 1933-1945. Secondly, the changing approaches in the study of the memorial sites and their management practices are reviewed. It is argued that it was not until the early 1980s that researchers gave due attention to the history of the sites. The early studies concluded that the sites were publicly neglected. This changed after reunification in the early 1990s when the educational work at the memorial sites was recognized and appropriately financed in Germany. First comprehensive documentations of close to 2,000 memorial sites in West Germany and former East Germany were presented by the mid and late 1990s. While the management at the main sites were examined mainly from an educational point of view, with the former concentration camp sites being recognized as places of learning (Lemorte), new approaches in the visitation of the sites emerged in tourism research: dark tourism, thanatourism and dissonance at the sites. In the last few years, studies were conducted that focused on sites associated with the victims as well as with the perpetrators (Opfer-/Täter-Orte). In the final part of the review, attention is given to the efforts made by geographers in this field. The conclusions outline the future task of a geography of memory. © 2017 Zentralausschus fur Deutsche Landeskunde. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={The heritage and tourism appeal of the First World War (1914–1918) battlefield sites holds similarities with past capital cities’ attractions and the cultural heritage, built structure and commemorative events fostered by government-backed narrative. Governments and associated institutions manage and communicate the ‘dominant narrative’ of official culture that generally concerns moral and emotional aspects of history, myths or legends. On the other hand, the ‘little narrative’ or vernacular attributed to individuals complements and enriches the significance of official narrative and links closely to public memory. Vernacular narrative derives from personal information, family history, diaries and privately held records that eventually become part of the dominant, government narrative. The combination of these narratives contributes to the continually emerging and reassembled discourse of the First World War because it links local and foreign people with one another in seemingly viable and tangible ways. The narrative passed from generations with first-hand experience to the present day intergenerational narrative that enhances the austere facts of history. Battlefield visitors are active consumers of historical events and builders of meaning that generate from a broad spectrum of sources covering government, ancestors and family. Consequently, events such as the Fromelles Interment highlight the impact of planning, promotion and management of specific tourism events by governments, various contributing agencies, the press and the general public. The idea of an interment moves away from thanatourism to the concept of restorative or reflexive nostalgic tourism because visitors related to the relaxed, festive atmosphere of the Fromelles ceremony as well as the dominant narrative behind this unique, singular event of remembrance. The Fromelles story, the creation of a new cemetery and the visitors' insights are unique because such an event is unlikely to be repeated for any other First World War battlefield. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={In today's world, the need to eliminate natural and human-made disasters has been at the forefront of national and international socio-political agendas. The management of risks such as terrorism, labour strikes, protests and environmental degradation has become pivotal for countries that depend on their economy's tourist sector. Indeed, there is fear that that 'the end of tourism' might be nigh due to inadequate institutional foresight. Yet, in designing relevant policies to tackle this, arts such as that of filmmaking have yet to receive due consideration. This book adopts an unorthodox approach to debates about 'the end of tourism'. Through twenty-first century cinematic narratives of symbolically interconnected 'risks' it considers how art envisages the future of humanity's well-being. These 'risks' include: migration as an infectious disease; alien incursions as racialized labour mobilities; cyborg rebellion as the fear of post-colonial otherness; and zombie anthropophagy as the replacement of rooted identities by nomadic lifestyles. Such filmic scenarios articulate the futuristic survival of community as the triumph of the technological human over otherness, and provide a means to debate societal risks that weave identity politics into unequal mobilities. This book will appeal to researchers and students interested in mobilities theory, tourism and travel theory, film studies and aesthetics, globalisation studies, race, labour and migration. © 2016 Rodanthi Tzanelli.

abstract={Dark Tourism, as well as other terms such as Thanatourism and Grief Tourism, has been much discussed in the past two decades. This volume provides a comprehensive exploration of the subject from the point of view of both practice - how Dark Tourism is performed, what practical and physical considerations exist on site - and interpretation - how Dark Tourism is understood, including issues pertaining to ethics, community involvement and motivation. It showcases a wide range of examples, drawing on the expertise of academics with management and consultancy experience, as well as those from within the social sciences and humanities. Contributors discuss the historical development of Dark Tourism, including its earlier incarnations across Europe, but they also consider its future as a strand within academic discourse, as well as its role within tourism development. Case studies include holocaust sites in Germany, as well as analysis of the legacy of war in places such as the Channel Islands and Malta. Ethical and myriad marketing considerations are also discussed in relation to Ireland, Brazil, Rwanda, Romania, U.K., Nepal and Bosnia-Herzegovina. This book covers issues that are of interest to students and staff across a spectrum of disciplines, from management to the arts and humanities, including conservation and heritage, site management, marketing and community participation. © 2017 Editorial matter and selection: Glenn Hooper and John J.

abstract={This paper suggests that the study of dark tourism or thanatourism tends to reproduce some old conceptual and ideological models of research. This becomes evident when we consider the absence of cyberepistemologies of dark tourism online and their covert communication with governmobility or governing the social through mobility. Of primary focus is here the management of humans through technologies facilitating the taming of death. Our engagement with literatures of thanatology and dark tourism as a type of tourism promoting consumerism highlights that (a) dark tourism has been limited to traditional terrestrial fieldwork of the tourist as a consumer and tourism as a marketing process connected to experiential authenticity, and (b) as a result, researchers fall back to moralized approaches to it as territorially-bound heritage. This conceptual schema connects to the old Western European split between technology and memory. Alternatively, unconditional support of digital technics tends to glorify labour to merely attack the spirit of postmodern consumerism. We note that setting the “gift” of technology and its technicians against the “gift” of dark heritage does not encourage rigorous epistemological analysis of the status and transformations of dark tourism in the cyber space because it does not take on board the historical dimensions of digital governmobilities. Instead of condemning technological means as instrumental and therefore inessential to contemporary social analysis, we have to (a) redefine the digital gift of dark tourism as temporary extension of life and (b) engage with Internet methodologies of digital dark tourism as an emerging theme in tourism analysis. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={This study aims to understand the language patterns that are used on websites for influencing travelers to visit Gallipoli by analysing emotive language and categorising it according to different segmentations of Gallipoli visitors. Websites promoting Gallipoli were identified through Google. Wordle software was used for conducting a website content analysis. The results show that the language used in websites represents a commemorative experience. The findings suggest a good fit between the descriptive language used to represent the dark tourism destination attributes of Gallipoli and the emotive language used to motivate visitors to the site. Moreover, the imagery of thanatourism marketed online was categorised by emotive language to identify discreet market segments. However, as the emotive language used online can influence the visitors' expectations, it is suggested that the former may result in visitor dissatisfaction. © University of the Aegean.},

abstract={This article provides readers with a critical analysis of Mexico's Parque EcoAlberto. Utilizing some of the theoretical work of interdisciplinary scholars who are interested in the study of “thanatourism,” the authors illustrate how this park, with its Caminata Nocturna (night hike), is much more than simply a “dark” tourist attraction that deters those who might travel North to the U.S. border. This study shows how the indigenous Hñähñú in Mexico have to confront a host of symbolic and material forces that are sometimes hidden in the patriotic metanarratives that swirl around this park. © 2015, © Southern States Communication Association.},

abstract={In the growing discussion of dark tourism, attention has focused on dark tourism theory, interpretation of tragic events, management of dark tourist sites, and visitor motivations. The local government component, however, has been overlooked in this field of study. Fame from notorious events often transfers to the city where it happened, sometimes sharing a name (the Amityville Horror, the Villisca Axe Murders, Auschwitz) whether the community likes it or not. This fame transfer creates a shared city ‘ghost’ lingering in its shadows, but draws curiosity seekers from around the globe. This study presents factors local governments should consider as they examine their role in dark tourism, including planning for site management, consideration of the safety of, and services provided to, their citizens, examination of potential economic benefits, and most importantly, to ensure that they have a voice in the stewardship of their history. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

funding_text 1={Kate Fox of Destination Salem said that the city provides in-kind services for the event, such as public safety, maintenance, clean-up, décor for the downtown area, and vendor licensing for temporary businesses. It is funded in part by the city through its hotel/motel tax, partially through advertising in the Salem Guide and Haunted Happenings revenue (Fox, personal communication, May 21, 2014). Throughout October, Haunted Happenings draws 250,000 of the almost 1 million annual visitors to Salem, and $99 million in tourist revenue each year (Haunted Happenings: Media & Industry, 2014). Haunted Happenings generates revenue for the community through parking fees, license fees, and a share of revenue from the annual carnival (Fox, personal communication, May 21, 2014).},

abstract={This research note describes an interconnection between touristic potential of localities impacted by the First and the Second World War, by focusing on a case study of cemeteries in the North-East of Slovakia. The case study proposes to create a Slovak part of the 'dark tourism thematic trail' through cemeteries from the First World War that could join the existing Polish part of the trail and thus gaining an international importance. The case study gives some directions for suitable touristic marking and marketing support by the official tourism bodies in respective localities, which can assist the necessary cross-border cooperation as well as the process of tourism innovation in the Slovak Republic. The conservation efforts to revalue sites and to promote thematic trail linking war heritage in the region have gained interest mainly from the non-profit organisation - Beskydy War History Club. A significant effort has been made to conserve and to exploit war heritage, however, site management and visitor interpretation for international tourists' needs seems to be neglected. Further dark tourism development is preconditioned by a cooperation of Beskydy War History Club and parties supported from public finance for marketing activities in tourism (DMOs).},

abstract={In this exploratory study the symbolic aspects of heritage tourism are considered from a consumer behaviour perspective. A qualitative study was conducted of key tourist sites in the Normandy D-Day landing region of France. Museums, cemeteries, gun batteries, beaches and plinths comprise the key significant sites of tourist visitation to the region. Using two seminal consumer behaviour models, Holts four metaphors of consumption and Belk, Wallendorf, and Sherrys Sacred and Profane dichotomy experiences and perceptions of five academics and their interaction with site visitors were compiled, compared and interpreted using key concepts of authenticity and verisimilitude favoured by MacCannell. The result confirms the a priori hypothesis that economic imperatives are at odds with perceptions of quality and sacredness, leading to the commodification of otherwise venerable sites. A number of quality determinants used to determine experience were also gleaned, namely historical significance, gravitas, ambience, number of exhibits, quality of exhibits, authenticity of exhibits, aesthetics in display and perceived respect in display. With due consideration to the criteria visitors used to determine experience quality, experience engineering can to some degree counter what appears to be an inversely proportional economic/quality dynamic. © 2015 © 2015 Martin MacCarthy, Gregory Willson.},

abstract={The purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the meaning of dark and memorial tourism better, as well as to create basic preconditions for relatively new concept of tourism in Croatia, as dark and memorial tourism is well defined subject internationally. Design - The theoretical background of the topic is been presented, and further institutional support for the development of memorial tourism. The special focus is given to analysis of the factors that influence the implementation of memorial tourism in area of regional economic development strategy according to the principles of triple helix but also quintuple helix cooperation - this type of tourism rely on support from the institutions, official tourism associations and local communities. Methodology/approach - Recent scientific literature analyzed in the paper (memorial tourism, dark tourism, thanatourism, phoenix tourism) present new advances and research results in the field of memorial tourism as theoretical reflection of good (best) international practice. It determines the views of the authors referring to the new trends of modern tourism consumers. Vukovar-Srijem County as a space of political and cultural importance allows, through its touristic production and consumption, for a ritual space that exists outside of time ("heritage that hurts", "life-changing points of shock", Stone, 2014). After identifying and analysing both the existing resources of the region and institutional requirements for potential development of memorial tourism a management proposal will be made for the development of a new concept of tourism in Croatia. Findings - According to the data of the Ministry of War Veterans of the Republic of Croatia (2013), up to May 18, 2011, 143 mass graves have been found in the Republic of Croatia, most of them in Vukovar-Srijem County. Inadequate cooperation between the tourism stakeholders and university sector, at regional i.e. national level and veterans' associations as the main drivers of development of memorial centres resulted in inadequately developed tourism product. Originality of the research - In the paper marketing is used as a mechanism to achieve strategic objectives of destination regions and thus, should be guided by the policies for regional development. The triple helix and quintuple helix innovation paradigm is based on the integration of commercialization, empirical knowledge, public good and civil society. To facilitate the development of memorial tourism, it is recommended to strengthen the cooperation with scientific institutions both in regional and national level in order to establish the facts and prevent further dissemination of occasionally false information about war time events and as a return measure suggest an acceptable marketing mix of memorial tourism product. Furthermore, tourism businesses, especially tourist agencies, have to become involved in receptive tourist programmes as soon as possible. Namely, the majority of tourist agencies are oriented towards emissive business operations. It is evident, though, that nothing can be done without a source of financing and coordination that can be provided by regional administration.},

abstract={This article outlines the development of Vietnam's Con Dao archipelago (and Con Son island in particular) as tourism destinations since the formal reunification of Vietnam in 1975. In particular it examines the nature of the area's two main tourism attractions, Con Son's prison sites and memorials and the archipelago's natural environment, and how these have been marketed to and experienced by national and international tourists. This discussion also involves considerations of the concept of thanatourism and how the latter might be understood to operate in a Vietnamese context.

abstract={This research note focuses on tourism to heritage sites with a controversial history and sites associated with death, disaster, and the macabre. Several new concepts and research directions have emerged in the study of such sites. Particular attention is given to the dark tourism and thanatourism approaches as well as to an analysis of dissonance in the management of heritage sites. Further, changes at places with a shadowed past are examined in the context of a revived geography of memory. There is a continued interest of the traveling public in revisiting war and peace memorials. In the final part of the research note examples of a new perspective on places of pain and shame are introduced. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={There has been much discussion by scholars about the efficacy of the term ‘dark tourism’ with a call to move from a theoretical to a more evidence-based approach to research. Recent analyses of dark heritage sites have shown that research has yet to engage fully with the experiences of tourists at dark sites. This paper seeks to meet this challenge by providing more evidence of the actual experiences of tourists at those sites which are conceptually identified as ‘dark’ using the particular example of battlefields in the UK. Based on a wide-ranging survey of battlefield sites the study used a blend of quantitative and qualitative methods to determine the nature of tourist experience. Central to this was a content analysis of visitor comments and vocabulary used to describe the sites. The results showed that visitors had a wide range of experiences but there was no evidence of a considered appreciation of the sites’ ‘darker’ aspects. Visitor experience here is casual and dominated by a lighter set of values. This is affected by the commercial nature of the sites which supports the assertion that thanatopsis is a rare feature of tourist visits. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Almost 20 years after the 1994 genocide, Rwanda remains confronted with the complexity of an enduring reconciliation process; a process both enabled and complicated by the arrival and increase of international tourism to the genocide memorials. Drawing on contemporary thanatourism, genocide, heritage and memorialisation theory and discourse, this paper critically explores the challenges faced by actors involved in the production and consumption of memorial sites in Rwanda. The paper reveals that the 1994 genocide is becoming increasingly incorporated into the national tourism product, a contested process that is both challenged and facilitated by the guardians of the memorial sites. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This article introduces a collection of eight revised papers that focus on the connection between slavery and tourism. After tracing the history of the former from its origins to the present day, and after providing some examples of related attractions, it confronts a number of dilemmas associated with their juxtaposition. A brief overview of the contributions to the volume is supplied, along with some epistemological and methodological concerns that they raise. Slavery tourism is finally contextualized within a framework of thanatourism, dark tourism and dissonant heritage, a field which in turn poses several questions for further research into this new and exciting phenomenon. © 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.},

abstract={This study seeks to account for differences between the UK and US in including sites of black slavery as part of their heritage tourism and museum agenda. Both countries were heavily involved in the slave trade and both currently have immigrant communities with an appreciation of their origins. However, and unlike the American situation, it is only recently that Britain has opened the contentious issue of slavery to public gaze. In this regard, attention focuses specifically on the mounting of a pioneering Slave Exhibition at Liverpool's Maritime Museum and, by interviewing its chief curator, various insights are gained as to the potential and pitfalls of such a permanent display of an inglorious past. Further interpretation is added by references to the general literature on heritage tourism, the emerging context of "thanatourism" and the framework of a Force Field model that can usefully accommodate the competing interests of rival stakeholders. © 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: In 1867, the author Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, undertook a great pleasure excursion across Europe. Visiting a range of sites, from those associated with the Christian Cult of Death to the notable cultural heritage attractions of the time, Twain published his experiences in what would later become one of the world's best-selling travelogues; The Innocents Abroad, or the New Pilgrim's Progress. This essay offers a rereading of Twain's encounters, proposing examination of Twain's encounters as timely and useful in addressing what Seaton identifies as a gap in data on thanatourism consumption. Design/methodology/approach: The essay draws on contemporary thanatourism theoretical frameworks, including Seaton's "Continuum of intensity" and "Thanatourism developmental sketch"; Sharpley's "Matrix of dark tourism supply and demand" and Stone and Sharpley's "Dark tourism consumption framework", among others, to explore Twain's encounters. Findings: Supplemented by a review of recent theoretical thanatourism research, the essay proposes three findings. Finding one illustrates that Twain's encounters, although not always pre-motivated or purposefully supplied, were emotionally charged and deeply affective experiences, which had the potential to provoke ontological insecurity. Finding two highlights the potential of the geography of death to stimulate emotional reactions and configure individual and societal interactions with death. Finding three argues a need for new methodological approaches to understanding the thanatourism experience; approaches that are empathetically sensitive to the potentially powerful impact of the thanatourism experience. Originality/value: The essay draws on a classic travelogue to help address the imbalance in knowledge of the thanatourism experience. The essay argues that thanatourism is a layered and complex phenomenon, highly personal and often a potentially powerful and emotionally affective experience. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: Commonly referred to as dark tourism or thanatourism, the act of touristic travel to sites of or sites associated with death and disaster has gained significant attention with media imaginations and academic scholarship. However, despite a growing body of literature on the representation and tourist experience of deathscapes within the visitor economy, dark tourism as a field of study is still very much in its infancy. Moreover, questions remain of the academic origins of the dark tourism concept, as well as its contribution to the broader social scientific study of tourism and death education. Thus, the purpose of this invited review for this Special Issue on dark tourism, is to offer some critical insights into thanatourism scholarship. Design/methodology/approach: This review paper critiques the emergence and current direction of dark tourism scholarship. Findings: The author suggests that dark tourism as an academic field of study is where death education and tourism studies collide and, as such, can offer potentially fruitful research avenues within the broad realms of thanatology. Secondly, the author outlines how dark tourism as a conceptual typology has been subject to a sustained marketization process within academia over the past decade or so. Consequently, dark tourism is now a research brand in which scholars can locate a diverse range of death-related and tourist experience studies. Finally, the author argues that the study of dark tourism is not simply a fascination with death or the macabre, but a multi-disciplinary academic lens through which to scrutinise fundamental interrelationships of the contemporary commodification of death with the cultural condition of society. Originality/value: This review paper scrutinises dark tourism scholarship and, subsequently, offers original insights into the potential role dark tourism may play in the public representation of death, as well as highlighting broader interrelationships dark tourism has with research into the social reality of death and the significant Other dead. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to advance the conceptualisation of dark tourism by evaluating both the supply-side drivers for dark tourism development and the demand-side motivations for visiting two dark heritage sites in Cyprus. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory research approach was adopted whereby 12 semi-structured interviews were conducted with supply-side stakeholders and two focus groups were conducted with local and foreign visitors. Findings: Production and consumption of dark tourism is continuous and interrelated as demand appears to be supply-driven and attraction-based. Tourist interpretations of dark tourism are influenced by tourists' personal factors, the passage of "time" and the way the dark site is projected by the supply-side. A refined marketing segmentation strategy is proposed taking into consideration the purpose of visit, the relevance of the dark heritage site to the tourist and the depth of the dark element. Originality/value: The study's focus is narrow but the findings provide theoretical and practical insights into the conceptualisation dark tourism by considering supply and demand aspects and the related influencing factors. In doing so understanding of the phenomenon is enhanced. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Based on data collected through familiarization and netnography we explore the different readings of the body at Von Hagen's Body Worlds. We ground our data in a reading and interpretation that draws upon some of the debates from a cross disciplinary social science analysis. These include cultural anthropology, sociology and psychology. We present five explanatory themes; the body as spectacle; the body as mortality salience; the body as commodity; the body as machine and the dehumanized body. In doing so we also respond to the call for greater attention to the consumer perspective within the field of thanatourism. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Gyimes is one of the few micro-regions of the Carpathian Basin that has a truly unique character. Here, traditional homestead farming and rural lifestyle support a distinctively rich folklore that has been passed down from generation to generation in its most intact form due to the isolation of this peripherally located and inherently secluded region. Given its abundance of natural and cultural resources, this territory could be a rightful contender for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) much-acclaimed World Heritage list. Zoltán Ilyés dubbed it the Folklore Museum of Szeklerland. A fairly large volume of inbound tourist trafic to Romania is made up by visitors from Hungary – 39.4 per cent in 2008 (Dávid and Bujdosó 2009). In 2000 the number of tourists from Hungary was 1.2 million. By 2004 this had increased to 2.6 million, only to see a sharp decline in following years – 1.5 million in 2005 and 1.3 million in 2006 (Institutul National de Statistica 2007). These numbers clearly indicate that besides ethnic tourism, other products need to be developed in order to stop the downward trend in guest trafic. New products have emerged, such as heritage tourism, religious tourism, thanatourism and gastro-tourism. By 2007 tourist flows started to grow, with the inbound tourist volume rising to 1.7 million, and tourism continued to grow to 1.9 million in 2008 and reached 2.1 million in 2009 (Institutul National de Statistica 2010). © 2013 Melanie Smith and Greg Richards.},

abstract={In Rwanda, numerous memorials have arisen to remember the 1994 genocide and its victims. This paper considers the effect of the national genocide memorials on Western tourist visitors, in the context of research on 'dark tourism' and Western attitudes toward death and the dead. It draws on the idea that, in a Western context, viewing the remains of violent death can be a kind of 'soft murder', and on the concept that the act of witnessing violence creates a community of witnesses implicated in that violence. Western visitors to Rwandan genocide memorials therefore form a community, and their responses are guided by a set of community rules regarding behaviour and experiences during and after the visit. These rules, this paper argues, are rooted in pressures to assert oneself as a properly moral individual through performing morality in a morally ambiguous setting. © 2012 W. S. Maney & Son Ltd.},

abstract={This research examines visitor experiences at a contemporary dark tourism site: the April 3rd Peace Park on Jeju Island, South Korea, a site commemorating and memorializing one of the most destructive episodes in modern Korean history. The study employed quantitative and qualitative research methods, with 46 semi-structured interviews forming the basis of a questionnaire, and 407 valid questionnaires obtained for data analysis. The implications of the findings are firstly that 'obligation' remains a key motivation for a visit, with a number of subsequent visitor benefits also identified. Secondly, that a benefit-based approach provides an effective framework for comprehending visitor experiences in dark tourism contexts. And thirdly, that a 'hot interpretation' of visitor experiences in dark tourism contexts remains particularly valid for comprehending visitor experiences, and in turn, for effectively designing and managing dark tourism sites within Asia and more generally. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper examines the underlying factors that affected perceived value among South Korean tourists who visited the North Korean Mt Kumgang resort. Results identified emotional, functional and economic values as core elements that directly affected guest satisfaction, which influenced intentions to recommend and revisit. Seen as a peace tourism site when the Sunshine Policy of rapprochement guided inter-Korean strategy, we argue that the resort project is a heterotopia of comparison combining idealized cultural and contradictory political spaces in one place. Understanding this needs Korean ideas that lead to a thanatourism with an indigenous perspective, which is applicable to other non-Western thanatourism-like sites. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Although the notion of a 'refugee camp' (imagined as a space of human suffering) and the term of a 'tourist attraction' do not seem to be parallel, the Tibetan refugee camps in India have been widely visited by different categories of tourists for years. These are the tourists called by Dean MacCannell modern pilgrims searching for authenticity. In my paper I examine the motivations of the "guests from the West" visiting a Tibetan diaspora and the way they are perceived by the "local community", i.e. the refugees. Using these criteria I have created seven categories of tourists, who I used to meet during a few years of my fieldwork done among Tibetan refugees: causal tourists, tourists searching for spirituality, tourists-activists, tourists-researchers, hippie-tourists, tourists searching for love and celebrity tourists. Me myself - as an anthropologist - had been often classified by Tibetans into these categories. Obviously, these categories are fluid, intersecting and changeable over time and place. Nevertheless, they are helpful in searching for the answer what attracts tourists to refugee camps.},

abstract={The Indian Ocean Tsunami tragedy was unprecedented. It prompted worldwide humanitarian relief efforts on a historic scale and mobilized governments to address public and private sector challenges in natural hazard preparedness, public health, infrastructure, and economic recovery. Several years later, many affected communities across the region remain devastated by the disaster. In Thailand, however, where the tsunami was the greatest natural disaster in the country's history, the recovery has been remarkable. The tsunami hit southwest Thailand along a 400 km (240 mile) stretch of coastline and offshore islands. The affected provinces include Phang Nga, Ranong, Satun, Trang, Krabi, and Phuket-the core of southern Thailand's tourism industry. The concentration of tourist services and activities near the beaches made them especially vulnerable to the devastation of the tsunami. The fast-growing Khao Lak resort in Phang Nga province, for example, with its string of low-lying beachside bungalows, suffered almost complete destruction. Similarly, on Phi Phi Don, a small island at the mouth of Phuket Bay in Krabi province, where most of the tourism facilities are packed onto a narrow isthmus averaging less than 2 m (6.6 feet) in elevation, the devastation was enormous. The tsunami surged across the isthmus, killing 1,700 persons and destroying 70% of the structures in the tourist center of Ton Sai village. The immediate post-tsunami recovery efforts in Thailand were motivated by basic humanitarian needs felt across the affected region. They focused not only on tourists and tourism resorts, but also on the coastal indigenous fishing villages and low-lying agricultural zones, where many people lost their lives or the means of making a living. The tsunami caused major damage to fishing boats (4,300 boats were destroyed in Phang Nga, Krabi, and Phuket provinces), as well as to aquaculture ponds. The waves washed across farmland, destroying crops, uprooting trees, carrying away livestock, and inundating soil with saltwater. The urgent need during the days and weeks following the tsunami was to help the survivors cope with their losses and to account for the victims. The longer-term recovery efforts were designed to rebuild livelihoods and restore crucial infrastructure. In the tourism areas, which contribute substantial revenue not only to the local communities but also to the national economy, the most pressing need was to get the tourism industry back on track as fast as possible (Scott and Laws 2007). The tsunami-affected areas of southern Thailand are located along the Andaman Sea, a region known best for its exquisite natural landscapes and marine resources. Phuket, Phang Nga, and Krabi provinces have international reputations as tourism destinations. Together, they account for 20% of the total annual tourism revenues in Thailand. Khao Lak in Phang Nga province, the newest of the areas developed for tourism, was hardest hit by the tsunami, with a death toll of over 4,000 (half of whom were foreign tourists) and property damage in excess of U.S.$350 million. The other tourism destinations in southern Thailand suffered varying degrees of damage. The beach resorts on Phuket Island are well established, dating to the early 1980s, and support the highest level of commercial mass tourism in the southern provinces. The smaller Phi Phi Islands in Krabi province constitute a spectacular cluster of islands accessible only by boat from Phuket or the Krabi mainland. These islands are popular among budget-conscious travelers and backpacking tourists for their crystal-clear snorkeling waters, imposing cliffs, sandy beaches (including the beautiful Maya beach made famous in the Hollywood film The Beach), and budget accommodations. To the east of the Phi Phi Islands, on the mainland of Krabi province, the Rai Ley beaches are popular among young travelers who come to climb the towering limestone cliffs that overhang the ocean or to kayak on the inland waterways. The post-tsunami rebound in tourism in all these areas was speedy, given the scale of the disaster (Rittichainuwat 2006). Their international reputation and the revenue generated from foreign tourists partially explain why the coastal communities here recovered so quickly after the tsunami when the coastlines of many other affected countries remain bleak and depopulated. The success of the post-tsunami recovery in Thailand, however, is attributable to a constellation of factors, not simply to the motivations of the tourism economy. In fact, many of the affected communities were located away from the tourism resorts, inhabited by indigenous traditional communities, and in need of assistance quite different from the tourism centers (United Nations Development Project 2006). On the one hand, the short-term humanitarian responses were immediate and multifold. The Royal Government of Thailand provided comprehensive emergency response in the region by mobilizing the entire civil and military agencies of the government. The urgent needs of the survivors were met by an integrated crisis coordination center combining the efforts of the Thai military and international search and rescue missions. The identification of victims was facilitated by forensic science technologies and an information-sharing Web site set up by the Ministry of Information and Communication. Relief operations were centralized under the Ministry of Public Health. The Ministry of the Interior mitigated the plight of victims by providing direct compensation to families for the loss or disablement of members, while the Ministry of Labour provided onetime payments to individuals who had lost their livelihoods. These short-term measures were designed to mitigate the most immediate and severe impacts of the tsunami. The long-term consequences of the devastation, meanwhile, were addressed in a mix of livelihood recovery efforts, social programs, early warning systems, and environmental conservation strategies. These programs include fisheries and agriculture initiatives, broadly defined community and social development strategies; and, in the coastal towns and resorts, investments to rebuild tourism. Much of this chapter examines the tourism component of the post-tsunami recovery landscape in southern Thailand, focusing on the major tourist areas of Phuket, the Phi Phi Islands, and the coastline of Krabi province. Arguably, and notwithstanding the more generalized human tragedy of the tsunami, it is precisely because tourism in the southern provinces is important for the country as a whole that the recovery efforts there were so speedy and comprehensive. Moreover, the fact that almost half of the tsunami casualties in Thailand were foreign tourists, and much of the property damage was sustained by internationally owned resort properties, meant that the country's recovery needs became an immediate worldwide concern. There is surprisingly little research on the impacts of natural hazards on tourism, despite the fact that many of the world's most popular tourist destinations are subject to catastrophic natural events or societal crises (Laws and Prideaux 2006). Alpine tourism, for example, must contend with the ever-present threats of avalanches, floods, and, in many mountain systems, (Figure presented) (Figure presented) (Figure presented) earthquakes (Nothiger and Elsasser 2004). Oceanic volcanic islands, such as those in the Caribbean and South Pacific as well as in Southeast Asia, pose the potential problems of explosive eruptions and toxic gases being spewed into the air (Meheux and Parker 2006). The impacts of the Indian Ocean Tsunami on tourism in Thailand were of an especially large scale, and they extended beyond the infrastructural damage suffered by the industry to the psychology of tourists and the international reputation of the destinations (Ichinosawa 2006). In some cases, tourists may actually be drawn to places of tragedy out of curiosity-a phenomenon called "thanatourism" (Lennon and Foley 2000; Seaton 1996). In a minor way, this attraction to places of tragedy is suggested to have been a motivating factor among some of the tourists who first visited southern Thailand in the immediate wake of the tsunami (Rittichainuwat 2007). More commonly, however, the tsunami destruction in Thailand kept tourists away, and the industry's concern, once the infrastructure damage was repaired, was to rehabilitate the reputation of the region as a safe place to visit.

abstract={This study concerns some of the military cemeteries that were built in Belgium and France by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission following the First World War of 1914-18. The cemeteries articulate one of the main social memories of the war to remember the dead individually. The performance of tourists and pilgrims in their visits to the cemeteries can be seen as ritual behaviour which helps to perpetuate the memories. The visitor books in 39 cemeteries were examined in order to identify reasons for visitation and patterns across sites. Three clusters were formed using the percentage of visitor book entries in which visitors made reference to specific graves. Half of the cemeteries formed into a cluster which had high visitation but where less than five percent of visitor book entries referred to particular graves.Most of these cemeteries were located close to well-known sites, battlefields or national memorials. A small cluster of seven cemeteries showed relatively low visitation but up to sixty percent of visitors sought a particular grave. The data indicated that relationships between national identity and particular cemeteries were important. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={In this study a quantitative method was used to measure the motivations for education, holiday and remembrance for an international sample of visitors to the Great War town of Ieper in Belgium. Three clusters could be formed based upon different structure and intensity of their motivations. A small number of visitors could be identified as pilgrims, while the remainder were tourists, and they evidenced most of the characteristics of the pilgrims. The theory of thanatourism provides a framework through which the motivations and experiences of battlefield tourists for remembrance and education as well as leisure can be better understood.

abstract={This study looks at difficult heritage tourism as a form of visiting that to a great extent happens through the tourist's body as locus. Actual tourists are craving for real experiences in order to feel alive and difficult heritage sites offer this experience of presence to excess. In addition tourists are also interested in witnessing the past and its victims, and the establishment of the witnessing relationship depends on the interactive design present at the site. The difficult pasts in question are situated on site-specific locations in Northern America and Europe and represent classic thanatourist sites bearing on Holocaust, totalitarian communism and terrorism. Through an analysis of the multimodal and interactive design at each site, the article outlines various ways that place designs relate actual tourists and victims of the past. © 2011, SAGE Publications.

abstract={This paper provides insights into the motivations and experiences of tourists who visit sites associated with war and conflict, specifically 25 individuals who participated in a tour of the World War One battlefields of the Somme and Ypres. The paper discusses the narratives of four of these individuals to illustrate in detail how such battlefield tours offer opportunities for pilgrimage, collective and personal remembrance and event validation. All of the participants had a prior interest in warfare, which was a key influence on their battlefield tour experiences. For the study participants battlefield tours emerge as complex, deeply meaningful and in some cases life-changing experiences. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study explores travel motivation on thanatourism of tourists visiting the disaster-hit beach resort of Phuket and identifies differences in tourist motivation between Thais and Scandinavians and between tourists of different age and gender. The findings reveal that curiosity about the outcome of the tsunami, desire to help local people, and safety were the most important travel motivations. Significantly, it is found that curiosity on thanatourism of tourists is not curiosity about death but about the outcome of the disaster and that it motivated only domestic tourists but not inbound tourists. In addition, the study suggests that curiosity acts as both a push and a pull motivation for domestic tourists. The findings also suggest that women are more motivated by safety and desire to help others than are men and that young tourists are the most curious regarding thanatourism. © 2008 Sage Publications.},

abstract={The First World War is now slipping beyond the realm of lived experience, yet it continues to wield a profound fascination over the British modern imagination. The Western Front in France and Belgium, which was the decisive theatre of operations for the Allied troops, has fashioned its own mythology and imagery and has secured a firm place in modern memory. Although the unremarkable topography of the region now visually betrays little of the momentous nature of the battles fought across its expanses, thousands of British visitors travel to the area throughout the year. This paper explores the ways in which tourists embarking on commercial coach tours engage with the battlefield landscape by examining contemporary tourist performance. It also considers the role of the tour guide in setting and directing the tourist encounter. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Cemeteries and burial grounds are major resources for historical archaeology, each containing hundreds if not thousands of individual monuments which are still visible, and a vast below-ground archaeology of burials with their fittings and funerary architecture in the form of catacombs, vaults and burial shafts. The preservation and management of such sites is an important element of CRM, associated as they are with emotions and identities in current populations (Bell, 1996). It is in this light that interpretation takes on a special role. The sites already have an importance to a wide range of people in the local community, but many of the historic and anthropological aspects of their value are not perceived and appreciated. Through communicating these aspects, individuals and communities may come to appreciate more such assets and protect them, which can in turn reduce vandalism and degradation. The public may also comprehend more fully the ways in which archaeologists understand the past through their study of material culture. Emphasis is given here to public interpretation rather than the use of graveyards in education. Many of the interpretative themes suggested here have not been offered to a wider public despite being explicitly addressed within curriculum development (Duca, 1974; Hill and Mays, 1987; Christie, 1991; Purkis, 1995; Mytum, 2000). Most urban cemeteries were established in the nineteenth century to provide suitable burial spaces for the growing populations of the increasingly industrialized cities (Curl, 1972; Brooks, 1989; Sloane, 1991). The motivations varied greatly for the establishment of burial grounds away from the control of the established church. Often a number of factors combined, but frequently included the provision of a less overcrowded burial environment with consequent improvements in health (Mytum, 1989), the ability of religious and ethnic minorities to have appropriate burial (Rugg, 1998), the creation appropriate landscapes for commemoration (Bender, 1974; Linden-Ward, 1989), and making a profit (Sloane, 1991). Rural burial grounds for whole communities, particular religious groups, or individual families, all have opportunities for interpretation on an appropriate scale. Each cemetery has its own history; its local causes for establishment, increases in size, modifications of policies, and changing landscape use around it. Yet many cemeteries can be placed in regional, national and indeed global perspective, as the reactions to similar problems can be seen to be resolved in a finite number of ways (Mytum, 2003a,b). Thus, the interpretation of cemeteries can be at the very local or regional level, or considering national and international trends. This in itself creates the opportunities for varied and alternative interpretations, without considering theoretical approaches that would also affect the emphases offered in readings of the remains. Examples are drawn from Britain, Europe, America and Australia to illustrate how similar both the evidence and the opportunities for interpretation are over many parts of the globe. Most cemeteries at present offer no permanent on-site historical or archaeological interpretation, or at most a few small interpretation panels as at the Granary Burial Ground Boston (Figure 25.1). Some, however, have developed materials in the form of leaflets for use by the local population, schools or tourists. Independently produced guides also exist, though most of these cover cities or regions rather than individual sites (Sarapin, 1994; Sive, 1998). With the growth of what has been termed dark tourism, which includes visits to battlefield and disaster sites as well as burial grounds, academic interest in this aspect of visitor has also received sociological analysis, and has even been provided with its own term, thanatourism (Seaton, 1996, 1999). Aspects of dark tourism often influence guided tours around cemeteries, though other themes such as history, art, architecture, symbolism, gardening and natural history all play their part. Thus, in New Orleans many tours emphasise voodoo and ghosts, though some offer much less dramatic examples, presented in a historical context (Figure 25.2). There are four themes that currently dominate cemetery interpretation: Great events; Great individuals; Architecture and oddities; and Carvers. It is worthwhile to examine each of these in turn, though many guides combine at least two themes, and some all four. The popular literature for burial grounds available today is remarkably similar to that produced when many of the cemeteries were newly opened in the nineteenth century. The emphasis is on aesthetics, architecture and famous names, all provided in an optimistic framework designed to be both improving and entertaining (Clark, 1843; Crafts, 1855). These may be fine goals, but there may be more relevant aspects to bring to the attention of visitors in the twenty-first century.},

abstract={Serial murder is a serious national problem, with substantial implications for tourism. In general, serial murder depresses business activity, with one important partial exception- tourism. The present study analyzes the relationship between serial killing and public travel and tourism associated with such criminal activity. It was found that serial murder is a quantitatively significant criminal conduct, and it is increasing. The general pattern of public response to serial murder includes reduced shopping and tourism behavior, due to fear. However, serial murder also stimulates public interest in visiting serial crime sites, and numerous cases of such travel and tourism have been caused by serial murder, as documented in the present study. Typical serial murder tourism activity includes travel, sightseeing, entertainment, dining, refreshments, lodging, photo-opportunities, and the acquisition of souvenirs. Wound culture theory may explain this type of tourist behavior, which falls within the emerging genre of thanatourism. Copyright © by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The following article will examine examples of current and theoretical issues in academic and related literature written on the subject of what has been variously referred to as 'dark tourism' (Lennon and Foley1), 'thanatourism' (Seaton2) and sometimes, 'atrocity heritage' (Beech3). Although much has been written on these subjects, little comment has been made on the types and relevance of research methods and analytical frameworks used in existing academic enquiry. The article comments on a cross section of publications written on this subject in the context of philosophical issues, research methodologies, emerging paradigms in the topic, contemporary debate and controversies. An introduction to 'dark tourism' is presented followed by a broad definition that considers the apocryphal issue of the origins of this subject in academic debate. Reflections on current research are presented, specifically research into issues of visitor interpretation and the representation of themes to the visiting public which can be considered 'dark'. A key observation is that most research in dark tourism has been qualitative in terms of methodologies adopted by researchers given the relevance of conceptual sociological issues that have arisen out of academic debate. However, the article finishes by considering potential usage of quantitative inquiry that could logically build upon the emerging, qualitative-driven paradigm. This article draws on an understanding of various approaches to research including epistemological and ontological positioning and the justification and application of research methods as they relate to findings. © SAGE Publications.},

abstract={Using Day of the Dead in the rural Mexican community of Huaquechula as an example, this paper analyzes how various levels of the state, in its roles as planner, marketer of cultural meanings, and arbiter of such practices, mediate between cultural tourism and local identity in a global context. It shows that the results have been met with opposition from some community groups. Although such opposition has caused the state to rethink its strategy, it remains intent on using its new program of cultural tourism as an alternative form of development in rural Mexico. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Thanatourism can be defined according to the motivations of those who engage in it. People who visit the sites of death are often motivated by curiosity over the deaths themselves. There are however, cases where such curiosity is not about death; and those who seek the experience cannot be considered as thanatourists. This paper argues for a tightening of the thanatourism definition by excluding people motivated to visit death sites for other reasons. This is illustrated by the example of thousands of Australians and New Zealanders who visit Gallipoli every year. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article introduces a collection of eight revised papers that focus on the connection between slavery and tourism. After tracing the history of the former from its origins to the present day, and after providing some examples of related attractions, it confronts a number of dilemmas associated with their juxtaposition. A brief overview of the contributions to the volume is supplied, along with some epistemological and methodological concerns that they raise. Slavery tourism is finally contextualized within a framework of thanatourism, dark tourism and dissonant heritage, a field which in turn poses several questions for further research into this new and exciting phenomenon. © 2001, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

abstract={This study seeks to account for differences between the UK and US in including sites of black slavery as part of their heritage tourism and museum agenda. Both countries were heavily involved in the slave trade and both currently have immigrant communities with an appreciation of their origins. However, and unlike the American situation, it is only recently that Britain has opened the contentious issue of slavery to public gaze. In this regard, attention focuses specifically on the mounting of a pioneering Slave Exhibition at Liverpool’s Maritime Museum and, by interviewing its chief curator, various insights are gained as to the potential and pitfalls of such a permanent display of an inglorious past. Further interpretation is added by references to the general literature on heritage tourism, the emerging context of “thanatourism” and the framework of a Force Field model that can usefully accommodate the competing interests of rival stakeholders. © 2001, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

abstract={This paper examines the historical evolution of Waterloo as a tourism mega-attraction. It locates battlefield visits as a form of thanatourism and explores the development of Waterloo through a sight sacralization model. The model proposes that an attraction's appeal is achieved through progressive stages of 'marking' which comes to invest it with a quasi-religious mystique, 'sacralization', as a goal of ritual pilgrimage for tourists. The paper comments on the sequencing of the model in the case of Waterloo and suggests how the social and ideological environments of the potential tourist may affect the potency and stability of the sacralization process over time.},
