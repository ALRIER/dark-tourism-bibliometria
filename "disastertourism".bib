abstract={By analysing the long-term effect of the Wenchuan earthquake on inbound tourist arrivals in Sichuan, this study probes the long-term recovery of inbound tourist arrivals in disaster areas. Empirical evidence reveals the existence of a “Blessing in Disguise” effect, as the growth of overall inbound tourist arrivals to Sichuan after the earthquake has significantly increased. Moreover, we show that this “blessing in disguise” effect is a specific phenomenon, contrasting with China's overall inbound tourism during the same period. This study contributes to the overall knowledge of post-disaster tourism recovery. Managerial implications for post-disaster tourism destinations are discussed. © 2019 CAUTHE - COUNCIL FOR AUSTRALASIAN TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY EDUCATION},

abstract={This paper contributes methodological discussions on collecting and analysing international tourists’ affects and emotions. The method of data collection used is electronic mail interviews, in some instances corroborated by participant observation in the field, whereas the methods of data analysis employed are affective mapping and emotionality of texts. Such methods of analysis capture the on-flow and contingency of the tourist’s experience in post-disaster places. E-mail interviews are becoming an increasingly widespread method of data collection. In post-disaster contexts, the potential of email interviews allows researchers to conduct fieldwork even when they cannot obtain face-to-face interviews, or in cases in which participants feel more at ease answering from their home and can take their time to respond. Twelve semi-structured e-mail interviews have been conducted in 2016 with international tourists who visited the Tohoku region, Japan, hit in 2011 by a triple disaster: an earthquake, a tsunami, and a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. To explore and better understand participants’ affective and emotional experiences, we exemplify affective mapping and emotionality of texts drawing on tools like linguistic features of e-mails, imagework, short stories and anecdotes. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

abstract={This paper explores travel risk associated with natural disasters focusing on a developing country context using a bottom-up approach. A mixed method was used to identify seven travel risk types from tourists’ perspective. The exploratory sequential design was applied to 52 respondents in the qualitative phase and 605 respondents in the quantitative phase. The study area was West Sumatra, Indonesia, a popular tourist destination that is prone to natural disasters. This study found different dimensions of travel risk and provide scales for future research in Indonesia and other developing countries. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Emerging from a research trip to New Orleans in March/April 2018, this article explores questions about the politics 'staging' wreckage in relation to conceptualizations and practices of tourism, class and race. Taking as it's central case studies a private vehicular tour of the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans (the area most devastated by flooding as a result of Katrina) and Goat in the Road's immersive, promenade production The Stranger Disease, the work seeks to understand how these two very different cultural objects might be seen to be 'staging' New Orleans in different but inter-related ways that illuminate and critique the politics of (disaster) tourism in the city, and cognate (urban) contexts. Reflecting on the phenomenological experience of the tour and the play in relation to more 'normal' modes of being a tourist in New Orleans, the argument proposes that the embodied experience of performance spectatorship can make radical interventions into process and practice of tourism by rupturing dominant paradigms of power, equity, race and environmental change. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Disasters destroy lives, make survivors suffer, and attract dark tourists. Community-based disaster tourism (CBDT) was born in such disastrous areas. Yet, little has been studied about the sustainable issues of CBDT, especially in the underdeveloped regions. This research paper addressed this gap by exploring the local residents’ perceptions of the CBDT in Yingxiu, China. Based on a survey and face-to-face interviews, this study found that the local residents’ feelings were mixed in facing disaster tourism. This study unveiled the residents’ paradoxical attitudes and the challenges and impediments of sustainable CBDA. Suggestions are made to the policymakers and CBDT advocates. © 2019, © 2019 Asia Pacific Tourism Association.},

abstract={How does ecotourism–conventionally characterized by its pursuit of a “natural” experience–confront assertions that “nature is over” attendant to growing promotion of the “Anthropocene”? One increasingly prominent strategy is to try to harness this “end of nature” itself as a novel tourism “product”. If the Anthropocene is better understood as the Capitalocene, as some contend, then this strategy can be viewed as a paradigmatic example of disaster capitalism in which crises precipitated by capitalist processes are themselves exploited as new forms of accumulation. In this way, engagement with the Anthropocene becomes the latest in a series of spatio-temporal “fixes” that the tourism industry can be seen to provide to the capitalist system in general. Here I explore this dynamic by examining several ways in which the prospect of the loss of “natural” resources are promoted as the basis of tourism experience: disaster tourism; extinction tourism; voluntourism; development tourism; and, increasingly, self-consciously Anthropocene tourism as well. Via such strategies, Anthropocene tourism exemplifies capitalism’s astonishing capacity for self-renewal through creative destruction, sustaining itself in a “post-nature” world by continuing to market social and environmental awareness and action even while shifting from pursuit of nonhuman “nature” previously grounding these aims. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

abstract={In this paper, we discovered themes from 2018 Mayon eruption-related articles through a generative statistical model. The article corpus undergone data cleaning before data processing. Based on the experiments conducted, the topic model which achieved the highest composition was generated using 5 topics, 15 top words, 500 iterations and 10 optimization interval as its parameters. Topic models which consist cluster of words were examined and manually labeled. The generative statistical topic modelling was able to draw relevant clusters of words from set of Mayon eruption-related articles. This automated approach aided in determining topic labels and analyzing the topic content out of the processed model. Themes discovered include, affected population and emergency assistance, volcanic activities, disaster tourism, flight status and volcanic eruption hazards. Presence of volcanic activity updates, calamity assistance from both government and private sectors and the destructive impact of eruption to the communities of Albay were revealed in the set of news articles. The discovered themes also show that in spite of the volcanic wrath, there is one positive impact which is disaster tourism. The lava flows and fountains pulled foreign tourists to visit the province. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Post-disaster tourism is often perceived as a form of Dark Tourism associated with death, loss and destruction. In Japan, the term Dark Tourism has gained prominence following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. This paper focuses on a community-led approach to post-disaster tourism development, initiated in the coastal area of Minamisanriku and labelled by the locals Blue Tourism. From its inception Blue Tourism incorporated non-dark activities which concentrated on the beauty of nature, social and environmental sustainability and the development of an enriched tourist experience. Its co-creational ethos helped transform some of the negative narratives of loss associated with Dark Tourism into positive accounts of communal renewal and hope. The paper highlights the limitations of Dark Tourism to post-disaster recovery and contributes new insights to the community-based tourism literature. We argue that Blue Tourism is not a type of Dark Tourism but a form of resilience which builds around local place-based practices and traditional community knowledge. Consequently, it is capable of achieving sustainable disaster recovery and tourist satisfaction simultaneously. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This paper explores the phenomenon of depersonalisation at post-disaster sites, a process of particular relevance to types of prosocial and group behaviour that are a desirable outcome from what might otherwise be a negative or distressing experience. To better understand the depersonalisation process, this study applies Self-Categorisation Theory to a post-disaster tourism site. Using personal pronouns and specific identities as markers, we explore the cognitive processing of visitors’ experience by analysing online comments posted after visiting one of two disaster sites: the Beichuan earthquake relics and the Yingxiu earthquake relics in China. The analysis revealed that three levels of self-categorisation were evident in visitors’ experience of disaster sites; particularly depersonalisation was uncovered through (i) ‘human being’, ‘China and/or Chinese’ statements, (ii) ‘we’, ‘they’ and ‘you’ statements, and (iii) individualisation through ‘I’ statements. As the theory predicted, depersonalising statements tended to be other-focused and co-occurred with the awareness of group prototype, collective action, positive in-group attitude and cohesion, ethnocentrism, and shared norms. This is the first paper to examine the depersonalising tourist experience in a dark tourism context and to explore its process and effects. Findings have implications for tourist experience design and the interpretation of post-disaster dark tourism sites. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Despite increasing research in dark tourism, few attempts have been made to explore local community perceptions of becoming the object of the dark tourist gaze, an issue that is of particular relevance at disaster sites given the potential sensitivity of local people to the intrusion of tourists in the aftermath of a disaster. This paper addresses this significant gap in the literature. Based on research undertaken in L'Aquila, an Italian city that in April 2009 suffered a devastating earthquake, it explores the responses of members of the local community to their city becoming a dark (disaster) tourism destination. In so doing, it reveals an evolving response towards tourism that not only contradicts traditional understandings of resident perceptions of tourism, but also points towards how appropriate responses to disaster tourism might support the disaster recovery process. © 2016, © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Over a decade after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, publics continue to come to terms with the tragedy. Isabelle Cossart, owner of “Tours by Isabelle” and survivor of the hurricane, began offering disaster tours of the affected areas after taking note of people’s desire to see the damage and contemplate its effects. Public accounts of Cossart’s business suggest that people make sense of disasters symbolically via tourism. Cossart’s post-Katrina disaster tours belong to a wider form concerning disastrous events springing from anxiety over how to respond, followed by agency-driven strategies for coping. This discursive dichotomy of disaster/agency is grounded in a homologous discourse of uniqueness versus copy in Walter Benjamin’s essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.” Through publicly available information on “Tours by Isabelle,” this article compares subcategories of disaster, Cossart’s tours, and works of art, and explores how people make sense of disaster symbolically. © 2018 Eastern Communication Association.},

abstract={Photographs have long been used as a means of interpretation at museums and other tourism attractions, including dark tourism sites. Typically, such photographs are documentary, recording or depicting subjects relevant to the theme of the site. Less common, however, is the use of representational or artistic photographs, and little is known about their effectiveness as interpretation tools. This paper addresses this gap in knowledge. Based on research in L’Aquila, Italy (the site of a major earthquake in 2009), it explores the responses of tourists to a photograph interpreting the disaster displayed in the city centre. It reveals that the photograph is a highly effective form of interpretation, connecting tourists with the human dimension of the disaster, although the provision of background information on the photograph would enhance the tourists’ experience. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={After a disaster, tourism declines and tourist stakeholders suffer because tourists cancel their reservations and choose to go elsewhere. A key part of managing recovery of tourism destinations is restoring the destination image and reputation which can be affected by negative or inaccurate media coverage. This paper reports the results of surveys with tourism sector stakeholders aimed at measuring recovery in three tourism destinations affected by two back-to-back disasters: the Bohol earthquake and tropical cyclone Haiyan in 2013 in the Philippines. The authors developed a methodological framework for the Tourism Recovery Scorecard (TOURS), which can be used as a crisis communication tool for benchmarking and monitoring progress on post disaster recovery of a tourism destination. Three main dimensions of safety, physical recovery and business recovery are considered in the Scorecard, each containing key factors that are important to tourists and meaningful to tourism operators. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This article discusses the case of Rikuzentakata, a town almost completely destroyed by the 2011 tsunami provoked by the Great East Japan Disaster. It shows how the town has directed some of its recovery efforts toward the development of a specific form of post-disaster tourism. Two main strategies implemented by the local authorities are analyzed in detail: first, the celebration of Ipponmatsu, or the Miracle Pine, a symbol of resilience in the face of devastation; second, the promotion of Rikuzentakata as the ‘Hiroshima of the North’. Both these discourses were based on the engineering and the apprehension of specific affective post-disaster atmospheres and perceived by residents and local authorities as key for attracting international visitors. Our analysis highlights how a politics of affect built around the tsunami has been spatialized and grounded using material landmarks (The Miracle Pine), but also narratives of hope and resilience based on comparisons with Hiroshima. Such affective atmospheres, we conclude, were planned and performed as an attempt to facilitate cross-cultural communication and allow visitors to contemplate death and disaster on their own terms, while at the same time involving them in a broader processes of healing from trauma and recovery for Rikuzentakata and its residents. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

abstract={This paper develops the concept touristic disaster as a heuristic device to examine the conflictual and contradictory aspects of showcasing disaster-devastated neighborhoods as tourist attractions. Touristic disaster refers to the application of tourism modes of staging, visualization, and discourse to reenchant the money making deterrents (stigma) of “destruction” and “ruin” and re-signify disaster to indicate “recovery” and “rebirth.” This paper uses empirical examples from New Orleans to examine the transition from “disaster tourism” to “recovery tourism” in tourism framings of post-Katrina rebuilding. The concept of touristic disaster views disaster-devastated neighborhoods as sites and arenas of contestation in which opposing groups and interests battle to control representations of urban space. The paper illustrates the motivations, processes, and paradoxical impacts of the commodification and global representation of “disaster” and “recovery” and provides insights into the ways in which people can use spectacle to contest marginalization. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This article discusses state-led heritagization processes in Beichuan and Wenchuan Counties, two Qiang ethnic minority areas severely affected by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (China). Certain destroyed landscapes were preserved and turned into earthquake relic sites. In particular, the former Beichuan County seat was entirely heritagized for memorial, economic, and patriotic education purposes, causing an emotional conflict with locals still affected by loss and trauma. At the same time, Qiang cultural practices were hastily registered as national and international intangible cultural heritage, while reconstructed Qiang villages were transformed into heritage tourism destinations. These initiatives tend to reshape Qiang culture elements into fetishized commodities. Allocating massive funds to historically marginalized regions, these post-disaster heritagization programmes aimed at boosting economic recovery, as well as demonstrating state power, national unity and solidarity. Implemented using a top–down method, they appear insensitive to the affected population’s trauma and the sociohistorical context from which the newly heritagized elements originate. The disaster and Qiang culture heritage tourism not only failed to bring about sustainable economic development to the earthquake-stricken areas, but also ignored to a large extent the initial goal of ‘post-disaster cultural recovery’ and the virtues of cultural heritage in recovery processes. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={After a decade of accelerated disinvestment and depopulation, Detroit (re)appeared in the national imaginary as an “urban frontier” open for (re)settlement by (mostly white) creative entrepreneurs. Recently, scholars have addressed the ways in which this frontier rhetoric arouses settler colonial desire for land based not just on a notion of black criminality or ineptitude, but also more fundamentally on an assumption of deferred white possession. Though this work has productively described the settler colonial conditions of racialized (re)development in the Motor City, it ignores white possession as a process that mythologizes Indigenous history and delegitimizes Indigenous people. In this paper I read Jim Jarmusch’s 2014 vampire film Only Lovers Left Alive as a “landscape of monstrosity” that inadvertently and momentarily recovers Indigenous and African American presence in moments of erasure and absence, as werewolves and ghosts to the white vampire elite and zombie working class. More broadly, I argue that Only Lovers Left Alive actively participates in an ideological process of (re)settlement that disguises land speculation (and its inherently disruptive cycles of uneven development) in a renewed frontier mythology. I read the film’s central characters, the vampires Adam and Eve, as disaster tourists whose nostalgia for Detroit’s lost civilization heralds in its renewed form. © 2016 The Center for Political Ecology.},

abstract={‘Disaster tourism’ is usually conflated with ‘dark tourism’ and also is often linked with disaster recovery. This article contributes to discussion on these relationships by examining the post-disaster narratives which have played out through tourism in the central Canterbury city of Christchurch, New Zealand, following the major earthquakes of September 2010 and February 2011. Through an analysis of regional and national media and tourism promotion material related to the earthquakes, the post-disaster narratives which developed in relation to tourism were observed. The article thereby highlights how disasters become framed through tourism, showing how post-quake tourism narratives can transition from narratives of destruction and loss to narratives of renewal and hope. The notion of ‘transition’, having become a powerful tourism product in itself, sheds new light on the relationship between ‘disaster tourism’ and ‘dark tourism’ and also between tourism and disaster recovery. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Within the tourism industry, the hotel sector's vulnerabilities are multi-faceted. This literature discussion scrutinizes how disaster and resilience is framed for the tourism sector, and, more specifically, how the concepts can be applied to the hotel sector. A synthesis of the literature points to the importance of prioritizing disaster resilience building for the hotel sector. The body of literature regarding disasters, tourism, and more specifically hotels, has increased over the last 20 years, still improvements in the hotel sector's disaster preparedness and do not appear to be on the same trajectory. Illustrating the predicament of the contemporary hotel industry serves to open a discussion about the value of building resiliency to disaster for hotels. As the numbers of people affected by disasters grows, the importance of providing actionable information to limit the severity of these events on communities also escalates in pace. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Tourism is one of the most economically important industries. It is, however, vulnerable to disaster events. Geotagged social media data, as one of the forms of volunteered geographic information (VGI), has been widely explored to support the prevention, preparation, and response phases of disaster management, while little effort has been put on the recovery phase. This study develops a scientific workflow and methods to monitor and assess post-disaster tourism recovery using geotagged Flickr photos, which involve a viewshed based data quality enhancement, a space-Time bin based quantitative photo analysis, and a crowdsourcing based qualitative photo analysis. The developed workflow and methods have also been demonstrated in this paper through a case study conducted for the Philippines where a magnitude 7.2 earthquake (Bohol earthquake) and a super typhoon (Haiyan) occurred successively in October and November 2013. In the case study, we discovered spatiotemporal knowledge about the post-disaster tourism recovery, including the recovery statuses and trends, and the photos visually showing unfixed damages. The findings contribute to a better tourism. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={The triple disaster on March 11, 2011 obliterated entire cities, leaving only scraps, shards, and severed lives in its wake. But it did not erase traces of memory, ghosts, and rituals that gave new life to long-abandoned public works projects, machi-zukuri (town-building) plans, and disaster tourism. Grief-stricken survivors could not protect themselves from a second wave called Recovery and Reconstruction that swept into Tōhoku. Powered by slogans of hope and solidarity to people in despair wishing they could go back in time, the corporatist state has reaped huge profits by promising to make everything like it was before. This chapter argues that the triple disaster allows us to observe the rivalry between capitalist and communal forces along Japan’s northeastern coast during the recovery period. Dedicated volunteers and aid workers from all over Japan and around the world gathered to help survivors recover from the trauma by mucking out fishing factories, visiting temporary housing communities to drink tea with elderly survivors, working on origami projects, and repairing fishermen’s netting. And reconstruction plans dwarfed their “soft” approach at recovery. For what drives disaster capitalism is not the qualitative healing of survivors, but the quantitative recovery of economic opportunities. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to address the knowledge gap in the field of dark tourism by understanding the phenomena of phoenix tourism, which focuses on the transformation and rebirth of places following death and disasters. Design/methodology/approach: The paper builds on existing theoretical understanding of dark tourism and disaster recovery to explore destination image recovery within the tourism industry. It uses phoenix tourism as a lens to understand the social, cultural and economic context of post-disaster tourism destination recovery and rebranding in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina. Findings: A presentation of post-disaster strategies and recommendations are given with attention to the re-branding of images once associated with death and darkness to enhance a destination’s resilience. Practical Implications: For local policymakers, tourism leaders, researchers and community developers, this research describes strategies that facilitate rebranding dark tourism sites, such as areas of rebirth or “phoenix tourism”, to enhance destination recovery image and to promote a more disaster- and risk-resilient tourism industry. Originality/value: This paper bridges the knowledge gap by defining and contributing to the theoretical understanding of phoenix tourism as it identifies the what, how and why elements of the phenomena of phoenix tourism. Furthermore, the authors propose how to overcome negative destination images to preserve, present or redefine an image of a tourist destination “overcoming”, and eventual “rebirth” serves to re-calibrate resilience of the tourism industry and regional redevelopment. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Developing nations comprise economically-weak societies, where a large portion of the population struggle to secure their daily basic needs. International Hotel Groups are often welcomed in such countries, with the expectation that their operations will contribute towards socioeconomic development. However, experience so far indicates that such investment has not contributed to the betterment of the residents’ lives. Hence there is growing demand, by many advocate groups and society at large, for corporations to benefit the communities in which they operate. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is increasingly used as a way for international Hotel Groups to give back to society. Based on this premise, the aim of this chapter is to analyze CSR practices and the way they are implemented in the following four hotels parts of international Hotel Groups: a) the Royal Oasis (Occidental Hotels and Resorts); b) the Navarra Hotel (NH) Haiti - El Rancho (Navarra Hotel Group); c) the Best Western Premier (Best Western Hotels and Resorts); d) the Marriott Portau- Prince (Marriot Group). All are in Haiti, the Caribbean, a post-colonial and post-disaster tourism destination. The study is based on a qualitative, exploratory, content analysis of secondary data, derived from the websites of the four hotels. The analysis indicates that the hotels exercise various CSR initiatives which could also benefit the country as a whole if they were closely aligned with its broader economic, social, and environmental imperatives. The study concludes that the Haitian Government should have a paramount role in the design and implementation of CSR initiatives used by International Hotel Groups operating in Haiti. On the one hand, this might represent a barrier to entry for hospitality investments into the country. On the other hand, it could be an effective way for the government to predetermine and gauge the responsibility of hospitality investment in host communities. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={The present chapter discusses to what extent the rise of new risks and dangers, modernity has brought, has causing the end of tourism. The answer to the above formulated questions is not easy, and of course, it exhibits a fertile ground to be explored in other approaches. The ceaseless news about violence, cruelty, wars and deaths have serious negative impacts on audience worldwide. Though policy makers have devoted their time and efforts in looking for new alternative segments where death replaces the allegory of beautiness, giving as a result new products as dark-tourism, slum-tourism, disaster-tourism or doom-tourism, other problems arise. The curiosity for tourists in visiting spaces of mass death or extreme suffering contradicts not only its nature as a mechanism of revitalization and relaxes but may very well lead to narcissism which in fact is the end of tourism. © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={ABSTRACT: This study explores the causal relationships between perceived destination ability, three dimensions of brand love (passionate love, emotional attachment, and self-brand integration), switching resistance loyalty, and behavioral loyalty. To test the proposed hypotheses, structural equation modeling was employed based on data from 417 Korean tourists traveling to Japan. The results show significant relationships between the study’s constructs. The results provide valuable insights into the extended model and have important managerial implications for Japan’s destination management organizers facing post-disaster situations. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This study identifies implications of dark tourism and describes how tourists and destinations, which are principal collateral cores, define what constitutes "dark" travel. The study also examines the dimensions of dark tourism motivation and experience and finds that the former partly affects the latter. The exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis aimed to examine why tourists approach and engage with disaster sites and how such experiences may affect tourists motivation and emotional reaction. It is the first paper that applies structural equation modelling to dark tourism research. We focus on the causal relationships between dimensions of motivation and experience, and the relationship that the emotional reactions effect on tourist experiences. We find that the curious visitors are likely to engage cognitively by learning about the incident or related issues and tourists' emotional reaction to the "dark" space influence more heavily emotional tourist experiences than cognitive experiences do. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Kanye West’s biting off-script comments about George W. Bush during the televised NBC benefit, A ncert for Hurricane Relief, are probably the most remembered contribution by a hip hop artist to post-Katrina critiques of racism. Beyond Kanye’s pointed remarks, other well-established rappers (including Mos Def, Jay-Z, Public Enemy, Lil Wayne and Juvenile) quickly employed hip hop music to speak out in sociopolitical protests against the overt neglect of New Orleans’s poor black residents. In recent popular television and film representations, hip hop continues to play a significant role in how we remember the effects of Katrina. In the 2008 documentary film, Trouble the Water, Kimberly Rivers Roberts’s hip hop lyrics affirm a sense of survivorship, shared and created through music. Similarly, in its second season (2011), David Simon’s HBO television series Treme explores the role of hip hop in post-Katrina recovery processes through a storyline centred on local bounce music. Some scholars argue that post-Katrina hip hop responses can be viewed as ‘disaster tourism’, or as upholding stereotypes about New Orleans as a space of either violent criminal activity or utopian racial exceptionalism. However, this article suggests that through rap music, Trouble the Water, and Treme, listeners and viewers are exposed to the complexity, diversity and lasting impact of a city (New Orleans) and a musical genre (rap), both of which are often accused of ‘selling out’, ‘watering down’ or profiting from what were once deemed authentic black music communities. © 2016 Intellect Ltd Article.

abstract={Although Italy is ranked as one of the five European Countries with a high probability of being exposed to a natural hazard, 75% of Italian housing stock does not meet any anti-seismic criteria. In addition to this already fragile scenario, the fact that Italy is one of the countries characterised by a rich cultural heritage opens new issues regarding the impact of a disaster on this territory. The current social science debate is already pointing out that the disaster’s recovery phase needs to move on from a physical and economic dimension towards a social and cultural one. However, much needs to be explored-especially in Europe-about how to deal with a tourist destination during and after a disaster. A “new normality” has to be found for the residents as well as for tourists and visitors. Beyond dark tourism, the recovery phase for a destination can work on finding new meanings and policies aimed at reshaping a new imagery which could encapsulate the tragic memory. The aim of this chapter is to present two Italian cases that in different ways have worked on the recovery/reconstruction phase within a touristic frame: the town of Longarone (1963 Vajont disaster) became a destination of a collective memory and the town of Comeglians (1976 Friuli earthquake) turned into an innovative tourist destination. Were these examples successful and can a lesson be learned from them? © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

abstract={This article examines as 'virtual disaster tourism' the US-internet public's mass consumption of digitized images of, and their virtual participation in, the humanitarian response to the destruction wrought by the January 2010 Port-au-Prince earthquake. Combining John Urry's concept of "the tourist gaze" with Mimi Shelter's theory of "uneven disaster mobilities," the article argues that the concept of virtual disaster tourism shows how mobility inequality is performed in the relationship between virtual tourists and the objects of their "gaze," who, immobilized, become spectacles in the touristic search for authentic connection with 'the other.' In example, I analyze a virtual 'experience' or game that takes users on a tour of post-disaster Port-au-Prince. The latter demonstrates the ways that new media technologies, largely inaccessible to subjects of the Global South, perpetuate and supplement longstanding stereotypes, fantasies, and constructed spectacles of Haitian 'otherness,' while at the same time revealing emergent fantasies in which the authentic 'other' becomes disaster as well as the immobile and contained Haitian victim.},

abstract={An observed trend, which can be defined as tourist interest in natural hazards and disasters, has persuaded the authors to attempt to research several issues, including tourist motivations and specific tourism properties and functions of this form of activity. The objective also covered the allocation of this social and natural process in the general structure of tourism. This interest has a long history, and a new stage is currently forming, which partly results from factors affecting society, such as information and education, which provoke antagonistic reactions. Extreme natural phenomena entail a common reduction of tourist interest in the destination which hosted the event; however, it never drops to zero. Differences are visible depending on the type of phenomenon. On the other hand, natural hazards and disasters are considered to hold a specific tourism value. This article discusses the allocation of this human activity in the tourism forms known to scientists, accounting for its diversity and relating to ethics. © University of Warsaw-Faculty of Geography and Regional Studies.},

abstract={The Caribbean archipelago is a series of independent island nations and overseas departments, territories, colonies, or commonwealths of developed countries. About 250 generations of human occupation in the Caribbean have produced a blend of traditions sometimes called a "cultural kaleidoscope." Eight thousand years of shifting cultural identities are recorded in archaeological, architectural, documentary, and ecological records, and in memories and oral traditions known as "heritagescapes." Caribbean heritagescapes are increasingly threatened by a combination of socioeconomic needs of modern society, ineffective governmental oversight, profit-driven multinational corporations, looters, and natural environmental processes. Balancing the needs of society against the protection and management of heritage requires careful thought and measured dialogue among competing stakeholders. Here we review the status of heritage in the Caribbean and offer a way forward in managing a diminishing supply of heritage resources in the face of current socioeconomic demands, and the unique legislative environments of independent island nations and overseas possessions of developed countries. Keywords: heritagescapes, stakeholders, contested memories, heritage consideration, Caribbean. ©Trustees of Boston University 2013.},

abstract={This experimental essay is a documentary-fiction account of two research trips undertaken in 2010 to Bhopal, India, and Bridgehampton, USA, by a photographer called Smith and an anthropologist called Willing. Their purpose was to investigate the social, cultural and environmental aftermath of the 1984 Union Carbide gas disaster in Bhopal, with a view to proposing ways in which the disaster might be exploited for commemorative, educational and entertainment purposes. Smith and Willing enumerate here on the ways in which photography and ethnography, as well as the disaster's 'materiality' - its routes and objects - could be used to generate a disaster tourism event in both Bhopal and Bridgehampton, the home of Union Carbide's former CEO, Warren Anderson. Part fantasy, part political and cultural critique, Bhopal to Bridgehampton also represents a meditation on authorship and the limits of the autobiographical gesture in ethnography. While their experiences are loosely based on some of the author's own, Smith and Willing are emphatically fictional characters. © The Author(s), 2013.},

abstract={As new crises emerge, it’s essential that the tourism industry be prepared to minimize the impact on both hosts and guests. Tourism Crises identifies key issues that need to be addressed in dealing with future incidents, examining specific cases of management success—and failure—with suggestions for improved responses. Academics, practitioners, and professionals discuss effective methods of maintaining yield during crisis situations, offering analysis, reflection, and new management strategies.
Topics addressed in Tourism Crises include:
• the significance of communication in crisis situations
• keeping the media informed
• attracting business after the crisis has passed
• how alpine areas can respond to the dangers of avalanches
• the effect of the SARS epidemic on Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan
• a typology of tourism crisis terms
• employee work stress in crisis situations
• quantifying the effects of tourism crises
• how tourism managers have re-tooled their promotional campaigns after 9/11
• and much more
Tourism Crises is a must-have for tourism professionals, practitioners, and academics as they develop new agendas for dealing with future crisis situations.
Don’t wait until it’s too late to learn how to manage a crisis situation
The impact of crises on tourism has increased in the last ten years in response to terrorism, war, health emergencies, and natural disasters. Tourism Crises presents the latest research on crisis management with in-depth analysis of tourism flows and the economic well-being of communities at the regional, national, and international levels. This timely book examines a range of conceptual issues, including crisis communication and the safety of employees of the industry, and features case studies of responses to the World Trade Center terrorist attacks, SARS, the 1999 Austrian avalanche disaster, and the epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

abstract={This section partly draws on some of the theories and issues that are pertinent to sociological enquiry, as well as geography and political economy. Earlier studies of the sociology of tourism focused on the idea that tourism was merely a form of escapism from the monotony or anomie of everyday life (Boorstin 1964). However, the sociology of tourism in a globalised world has produced a multiplicity of tourist gazes and there are now countless mobilities (Urry 2002), causing rapid and radical changes in tourist typologies and categorisations, which are becoming more fluid. Consumer psychology, mass media, communications and new technologies have had a major influence on the sociology of tourism. Issues relating to tourism as a form of citizenship, a human right, problems of social exclusion and how to increasethe accessibility of tourism are all critical issues in cultural tourism studies too. Mobility has become a highly significant topic in tourism research in recent years. It transcends disciplinary boundaries in its coverage of political, technological, social and ultural developments. Mobility is clearly at the heart of our understanding of tourism with its global transport networks, international business connections and policy frameworks, flows of images and representations, exchange of cultures and social interactions. It is important also to consider the concept of immobility in the context of tourism, as it has a significant bearing on the nature of host-guest interactions (i.e. where hosts never travel beyond the destination). There are also political issues relating to border control, political and social conflicts and safety issues which can hinder the development of tourism. Kevin Hannam and Sujama Royin this section analyse the relationship between cultural tourism and the new mobilities paradigm. They argue that tourism is now an integral rather than marginal part of everyday social and cultural life; however, it is becoming harder to distinguish between tourism and other mobilities. Karolina Buczkowska gives an interesting example of a specific kind of social mobility, which is the ERASMUS phenomenon. Students travel and study or work in a foreign environment and, she argues, become ‘ambassadors of cultural tourism’ in the process. The themes of embodiment and performance are alluded to by Hannam and Roy, and are then discussed in more depth by Kevin Meethan in this section. Corporeal and social performances in tourism mean that the self is being contingently produced. Tourists are rarely conscious of their performances, although they are likely to be somewhat predictable in the sense that their experiences are usually foregrounded by historical, social and cultural education or even indoctrination, as well as media representations and images. There may be elements of improvisation in tourism, especially when it involves interactions with host communities; however, the theme of ‘staging’ has also been well-documented in tourism studies. Meethan suggests that cultural tourism studies would benefit from a more reflexive analysis of the individual’s experience, including elements of multi-sensory engagement andperformance. The age-old social phenomenon of hospitality is revisited in this section by both Tom Selwyn and David Picard to illustrate its traditional origins as a social and cultural phenomenon. David Picard’s chapter considers cosmopolitanism rather than globalisation as a meta-narrative for understanding global tourism and encouraging more ethical approaches. He argues that this is a political and philosophical movement with the guiding principles of world citizenship and the defence of equality. He questions the power-based decisions that traditionally have dominated international organisations, often hampering the development of a more ethical tourism industry. He suggests that a return to the traditional and historical meaning of hospitality, as outlined by several philosophers, may be the key to redressing imbalances in tourism and increasing its positive role in world citizenship. Tom Selwyn discusses the important role of hospitality in forging human relationships with strangers, foreigners oreven perceived enemies which can take us beyond hostility. Traditionally, guests were even seen as being touched with a divine or sacred quality, whereas today these are often overlooked in favour of commercial effciency. The natural human orientation towards the darker side of life is explored by Karel Werdler in this section, but one chapter does not really do justice to the growing interest in dark tourism. The new millennium has so far proved to be fairly turbulent, with its global terrorism, environmental catastrophes, economic and political crises, therefore the interest in disaster tourism is unlikely to wane anytime soon.Whole books have been devoted to the theme of dark tourism (e.g. Lennon and Foley 2000), as tourists are increasingly drawn to both historical and contemporary sites which commemorate past tragedies. Smith et al. (2010) summarise the categorisation of dark tourism which seems to have emerged in recent years. This ranges from Rojek’s (1993, 1997) concepts of ‘black spots’ and ‘sensation sites’ - the former referring to places marking death, the latter to sites where a disastrous event took place - to Seaton’s (1996) ‘thanotourism’ where visitors are motivated by an interest in death, to Tunbridge and Ashworth’s (1996) ‘heritage of atrocity’ or ‘dissonant heritage’. Werdler provides an interesting in-depth analysis of ‘Dark Exhibitions’, including artists’ different representations of death and dying, the activities used to engage visitors, and their motivations and responses. This chapter makes us question the most effective and sensitive ways to depict dificult and emotional subjects at cultural attractions and sites. Non-religious or secular spirituality is a subject that is not explored by the authors in this section, but is alluded to by Erik Cohen in his work on tattoo tourism and the religious signs and symbols that are misused or misunderstood by tourists. It is important to note that in many tourist-generating countries, especially in the West, a slow but steady spiritual revolution is taking place in which secular spirituality is taking over from traditional religion (Heelas and Woodhead 2005). This means that tourists are increasingly inclined to copy those aspects of religious or spiritual practices that they find most appealing without much concern for their origins. Cohen’s (1996) earlier work on tourism described how the quest for a ‘spiritual centre’ is an integral part of tourism, especially when people feel socially alienated. This often involved a process of sampling ‘alternative’ rituals. Tattoos can provide a permanent reminder or marker of this spiritual journey. Kevin Hannam and Sujama Roy argue that tourism is now an integral part of everyday social and cultural life alongside other mobilities with which it has a ‘fluid interdependence’. Mobilities and immobilities tend to take place in tourism ‘cultural contact zones’, which are the sites of complex interactions and identities. Although cultural tourists may be more inclined towards immobility for some of their stay so that they can fully engage with the location and its people, they may also experience cultural encounters while on the move (i.e. during travel to a destination). Urry’s (2007) five independent ‘mobilities’ are used to analyse cultural tourism, including corporeal travel as an embodied experience, physical movement of objects (such as cultural souvenirs), imaginative travel including images of places and peoples, virtual travel (e.g. fantasies, myths and simulations), and communicative travel via media, internet and mobile phones. However, the authors suggest that there is a need for better maps of the sensuous and emotional geographies of cultural tourism, especially the notion of performativity. Karolina Buczkowska discusses a particular form of mobility in cultural tourism that has become a widespread social phenomenon, and that is the travel of ERASMUS students. This includes those studying and undertaking internships abroad, usually for a period of three to twelve months. They therefore spend considerably longer in a destination than many other tourists, and usually have access to increased information about the place, its history, its people and their social and cultural traditions. They can therefore become far more immersed in the atmosphere and absorb the place more leisurely and profoundly. She argues that ERASMUS students have increasingly become ‘ambassadors’ of cultural tourism because of their special status in representing their country for extended periods abroad, their development of close relationships with local people, and their enhanced understanding of social, intellectual and linguistic aspects of culture. KevinMeethan analyses in more depth the notion of embodiment and performance, especially insofar as it relates to human agency and individuation in society. In tourism, performance can relate to the staging of rituals or spectacles by communities, or the gathering of certain ‘props’ in order to enact the role of an individual tourist. He suggests that performance is an integral or embodied part of everyday life, sometimes involving improvisations, including in our interactions with others. However, he also suggests that individuals sometimes have little agency or freedom to improvise and are forced to conform. This is not only because of enforced political or social regimes, but also because many of our experiences (including tourism) are already foregrounded by history, society, culture, media, etc. Embodied practices also take place in constantly shifting and interactive spaces, not on an empty, static stage. Wider narratives of society, including collective memory, are as influential as personal narratives, although the reflexive, engaged, sensory performance of the individual is still highly significant. David Picard analyses the relationship between cosmopolitanism and hospitality, which he links closely to philosophical and political debates. Cosmopolitanism has become aninternational meta-narrative which advocates world citizenship and hospitality in its traditional sense (i.e. the welcoming of strangers or foreigners into one’s home or land). Cosmopolitan ethics are now being seen as a guiding moral for many international organisations and nations wishing to address issues of unequal treatment of people, unequal flows of tourists, and inhospitable treatment of certain groups of people. Alternative tourism discourses are invented to address these issues, but they rarely succeed as they are not deeply embedded enough in the whole of the tourism and hospitality industries. However, education, inter-cultural dialogue, and the promotion of hospitality in its traditional sense can play a keyrole in this development. Tom Selwyn analyses the phenomenon of hospitality using a highly original approach, exploring the main themes as depicted in works of art. He argues that traditional understandings of hospitality have been lost as the industry increasingly focuses oncommercial effciency. He suggests that hospitality was traditionally based on a number of fundamental premises, such as symbolic manifestations of social status and political power, an exchange of honour, but also a recognition of the sacredness or ‘divinity’ of guests. This relates partly to the offering of ‘sanctuary’ to visitors. Hospitality can also be a direct expression of pleasure, excesses and hedonism, but still be bound by rules of social etiquette. He also discusses the relationship between hospitality and hostility, at first glance polar opposites, but on closer examination, inextricably linked both etymologically and conceptually. The word originally refers to strangers or foreigners, but also to enemies. Refugees from political conflict may be accommodated in tourist spaces or seek asylum amongst foreigners in other countries. Overall, the concept refers to the establishment of relationships, not all of which can be harmonious but can still be hospitable rather than hostile. Karel Werdler analyses the phenomenon of dark tourism and its role in the field of cultural tourism. Using a case study of the Netherlands, he explores different categories of dark tourism. This includes military or war heritage, prisons, cemeteries, funerary art and exhibitions. This is followed by an in-depth study of dark exhibitions over the past 20 years. He examines the content of the exhibitions, such as the main themes, and the number of visitors. He focuses on those exhibitions that have dealt with death and dying, including the representation used by different artists to depict the phenomenon or process. He especially notes those exhibitions that provided some kind of interactive visitor experience deemed unique or innovative. He examines the reactions of visitors to the exhibitions, as well as their original motivation to visit. Interestingly, many of them were positive, indicatingthat the treatment of dark and dissonant subjects is not something to be shied away from in the development of cultural tourism, but to be carried out with as much sensitivity as possible. This need not exclude innovative and creative approaches. Finally, Erik Cohen examines the rather unusual subject of tattoo tourism, which he rightly identifies as being under-researched in cultural tourism studies. Tattooing has become a much more mainstream activity in Western, middle-class society in recent years, and this interest has extended to tourism. This includes tattoo-related events, such as international tattoo conventions and exhibitions. In particular, tourists tend to visit Thailand, where the art of tattooing also has cultural and spiritual significance and is considered to be a ‘living tradition’. Although it is not a Buddhist custom, some tattoos are actually performed by Monks in temples. However, there are concerns that the meaning and significance of many designs and symbols may not be fully understood by foreigners and could be misused. This is especially true of religious symbols, which have been deemed inappropriate by the Thai Ministry of Culture, a controversial intervention which was thought by some to compromise artistic freedom and business development. © 2013 Melanie Smith and Greg Richards.},

abstract={This article explores the role of scripted cable television in the making and remaking of place in the conjuncture of postdisaster crisis and the neoliberal transformation of urban space. I suggest that Treme contributes to the remaking of New Orleans by engaging conceptions of authenticity, dwelling on the elements of cuisine, music, and diversity that mark New Orleans as distinctive, and highlighting individual enterprise as a condition of possibility for remaking post-Katrina New Orleans. I also suggest that because it makes for compelling quality television and provides badly needed publicity and temporary economic stimulus for the local economy, Treme, the show and the HBO production, through no fault of its own, displaces critical engagement with public policy choices and state-centered redress for economic, cultural, and social injustice and inequality. © Author(s) 2012.},

abstract={This paper presents insights on how to rebrand a nation with a negatively viewed brand name and identity caused by disaster, atrocity or political upheaval, to stimulate tourism. Following a review of the literature, the authors conceptualise the notion of negatively viewed nation brand and propose a positioning model for rebranding negatively viewed nation brand identity. The study reveals that nation brand association and identity redeployment in post genocide or natural disaster are critical resources for an effective nation rebranding exercise. The study provides insights on how tourism marketers can successfully leverage nation rebranding to stimulate tourism in the aftermath of a disaster. It proposes a theoretical framework for nation rebranding in post atrocity in emerging markets. © 2012, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The devastating Haiti earthquake rightly resulted in an outpouring of international aid. Relief teams can be of tremendous value during disasters due to natural hazards. Although nobly motivated to help, all emergency interventions have unintended consequences. In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, many selfless individuals committed to help, but was this really all in the name of reaching out a helping hand? This case report illustrates that medical disaster tourism is alive and well. © 2010 World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine.},

abstract={Whether moved by curiosity, the notoriety of certain places, its historical value, etc., or by morbid curiosity, it's a fact that from immemorial time pain, grief, death, inequality, hunger and so on a endless list of painful facts, have been commercialized in the tourist market. Some recent catastrophes are good examples of this, such as 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York, hurri- cane Katrina in New Orleáns, the tsunami that devastated the Asian southeast or the Prestige oil spill. These four cases are different in the nature of the catastrophe, which is irrelevant to our subject, however they are comparable by its contemporary character, the high impact caused in the public opinion due to the intense following up of the mass media and, of course, the affecta- tion of the touristic activity. As a result, it́s observed that the context is fundamental to explain the exploitation of the catastrophe and, particularly, the degree of destruction of the touristic infrastructure, the destination dependence of the tourism and the impact on the visitors' affluence. Furthermore, it́s verified that, in the Costa da Morte case, versus the ethically negative connota- tions of the dark tourism, positive aspects are present, as in the arrival of volunteers, during the months that followed the catastrophe, being this one of the explicative factors of the overnight stays growing in the area.},

abstract={Purpose – The paper's primary goals are three-fold: to explore how disaster tourism serves as a vehicle for self-reflection in respect to how the disaster tour affects the tourist; to understand how cultures adapt to abrupt change; and to understand how the tourism industry can lead to the cultural and economic revitalization of devastated areas. Design/methodology/approach – This paper draws on sociological theory, experience, and participant observation to complete an autoethnographic study of a “disaster tour” in and around the New Orleans, Louisiana, metropolitan area. Findings – Conveying information via auto-ethnographic disaster tourism helps readers develop an understanding of others by being immersed in the tour experience. Placing the researchers in the midst of the analysis presents a perspective of the cultural mix of New Orleans as place set apart, even among places in the south. Finally, this study highlights the importance of a rapidly rebounding tourism industry by “branding” New Orleans as a “Come back city.” Research limitations/implications – Because the research employs an auto-ethnograpic approach, it may not be possible to duplicate the observations and findings, which are subject to the interpretations of the reader. Originality/value – The contribution of this work to the literature is its highlighting of the flexibility of the tourism industry after a catastrophe and noting that tour guides frame the reconstruction process as “signs of hope” and “rebirth,” rather than a city in decline. Readers come to understand that the key to the revival of New Orleans is how disaster tourists understand the disaster as well as the recovery process. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={Before hurricane Katrina, "cultural tourism" was Louisiana's second largest industry. Tourism agencies are now imploring potential tourists to visit New Orleans for "An eyewitness account of the events surrounding the worst natural disaster on American soil!" Economic need is driving tour agencies to construct 'eco-disaster tourism,' and the construction includes explicit causes of blame. Who is defining the new tourism? How is the controversy surrounding causation being negotiated in eco-disaster tour narratives? e main finding is that the big players in the tourism industry, namely Gray Line Tours, have maneuvered into a powerful position to rewrite the tourism narrative by allying with the state. Gray Lines' narrative blames the oil and gas industry for Katrina's severity, while avoiding pointing fingers at government agencies and officials. © 2007 Brill Academic Publishers.},

abstract={This paper uses the theoretical and analytical resources of critical theory to explore the processes and conflicts over efforts to present tragic events as spectacles, focusing on a case study of the Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans. Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent government response have intensified uncertainty and unpredictability, disclose a new insecurity in US cities, and showed how a predicted disaster could wreck havoc within the US economy and political system. I first examine the ways in which the logic of spectacle and entertainment permeate a major disaster like Katrina. Next, I investigate how media coverage and political commentary on Katrina insinuates its own immanent critique of racial and class divisions in urban America. Finally, I draw attention to how critical tendencies are immanent to the commodification process itself, in the form of disaster tourism and the production of Katrina souvenirs that embrace spectacle to criticize federal policy and build global awareness of New Orleans's plight. Overall, my goal is to show how the category of immanent critique can play an important role in drawing out the implications of disaster-as-spectacle, illustrating the intersection of race and class in US cities, and highlighting the multidimensional, conflictual and contradictory character of spectacles.},

abstract={In recent years, analysts have focussed on building a range of strategic responses to enhance the ability of communities and businesses to manage and recover from natural disasters. The experience from each new crisis adds further to the process of hazard management. The results in tourism research have expanded the community's collective capacity to respond to such circumstances, but little consideration has been given to how small firms, which are the mainstay of the industry, actually deal with the impacts of a regional catastrophe. The 2003 bushfires in northeast Victoria (Australia) devastated over 1.1 million hectares, destroying the livelihood of some operators and leaving more than one thousand small tourism firms without a revenue base. This paper examines how they prepared for, and recovered from, the event. Perhaps not surprisingly, it exposes their vulnerability and lack of preparedness for dealing with a hazard of this magnitude. On the other hand, it demonstrates the resilience of real-world operators and their reliance on accumulated experience to manage their own recovery. There are lessons here that may well apply in similar circumstances. For example, the paper notes the inadequacy of insurance as a risk management strategy, but emphasizes the value of collective approaches to marketing to rebuild the confidence of future visitors. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Background: At 08:53 hours on 26 January 2001, an earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale devastated a large, drought-affected area of northwestern India, the state of Gujarat. The known number killed by the earthquake is 20,005, with 166,000 injured, of whom 20,717 were "seriously" injured. About 370,000 houses were destroyed, and another 922,000 were damaged.Methods: A community health worker using the local language interviewed all of the patients admitted to the Gandhi-Lincoln hospital with an on-site, oral, real-time, Victim Specific Questionnaire (VSQ).Results: The census showed a predominance of women, children, and young adults, with the average age being 28 years. The majority of the patients had other family members who were also injured (84%), but most had not experienced deaths among family members (86%). Most of the patients (91%) had traveled more than 200 kilometers using their family cars, pick-ups, trucks, or buses to reach the buffer zone hospitals. The daily hospital admission rate returned to pre-event levels five days after the event, and all of the hospital services were restored by nine days after the quake. Most of the patients (83%) received definitive treatment in the buffer zone hospitals; 7% were referred to tertiary-care centers; and 9% took discharge against medical advice. The entrapped village folk with their traditional architecture had lesser injuries and a higher rescue rate than did the semi-urban townspeople, who were trapped in collapsed concrete masonry buildings and narrow alleys. However, at the time of crisis, aware townspeople were able to tap the available health resources better than were the poor. There was a low incidence of crush injuries. Volunteer doctors from various backgrounds teamed up to meet the medical crisis. International relief agencies working through local groups were more effective. Local relief groups needed to coordinate better. Disaster tourism by various well-meaning agencies took a toll on the providers. Many surgeries may have contributed to subsequent morbidity.Conclusions: The injury profile was similar to that reported for most other daytime earthquakes. Buffer zone treatment outcomes were better than were the field and damaged hospital outcomes. © 2014 World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine.},

abstract={This paper suggests that the tourism industry does not have to become an economic loser following large disasters. Planning and mitigative efforts can position the industry to function after a disaster. We suggest that current planning can draw upon current general knowledge about disaster behavior. For example, altruism and mass convergence also effects the tourism industry following disaster. Role abandonment and panic do not happen after disaster. Finally, we suggest that a systematic research program can enhance the tourism industry’s efforts to respond and recover from disaster. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},
